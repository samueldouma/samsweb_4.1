It's been described to me as a diner that has dodged gentrification by none other than one of those Instagram news. Social media conglomerates which make as much money as the big boys now.

I have no clue until I ask the doctor and he told me to use ingredients. Do you know one in four Americans don't know about ingredients? All my girlfriends talk about ingredients and I didn't know that was right for me until I found ingredients. That was just the first step on my ingredient journey. It's exhausting, baby. I mean, I have to love food. I have to be sexy. I have to provide her with family. And I have to eat all my favorite ingredients. So many ingredients. I have to love to do the whole thing. I am so glad I'm the first seller in big, but I have an ingredient. I have to be sexy. I have to provide her with family and friends and general general. You need them. I have to have them. And you should. Now I know it's true. You have to talk to my children about ingredients. My kids have been friends for years. And they're tired. Successful, successful. Beautiful. Baby. And now you know about ingredients too. Ask your doctor about ingredients. Oh. I'm working on it. What's that? Oh, barbecue. Sounds fun. Can't do it. I got to read the book. I love reading. Reading is a lot of fun. And I can't do it when I have body over. Is body owner getting in the way of your priorities? With priorities, you can focus on what really matters to you. What's that? Oh, no. I'm sorry. I can't. I have to read the book. I don't have time actually. I have something to do with it. I couldn't possibly go to the bar to kill my period. Who knows what I'll do. If you're a period holding back with priorities, you can focus on what really matters to you. What's that? Oh, a barbecue? I couldn't. I have to read the book. I like reading lots of books. I'm a study girl. Being a little fence in the way of my reading. I can't read. I try to make the words and they look all scrambled. So I try to find a product that can stay with me. And unscramble my life. Is reading being in the way of your reading with priorities? You can focus on what really matters to you. What's that, Jerry? Oh, a barbecue. I wish. This always happens. I gotta read instead of going to barbecues. There's only one thing that gets in the way of your reading. And that's priorities. Do you use priorities on a regular basis? If so, you may be entitled to financial compensation. I'm so glad I asked my doctor about my priorities. It worked for me. Priorities. Free to view. Free.

The opera? Can you hear the guy? I know that there's a sound performance over that way. Where? Like really far at the end, but I think it's done with. So maybe they're doing something else there, I don't know. It's so weird every time my ass stops. Yeah. Are you selling these books? Why? What was your interest? I'm interested in this song. It's a bit busted up, so I don't know. Have a seat. Okay. I've been working with the chimpanzees, so no, but have a seat please. Okay. Can I have a seat with that? Is that okay? Okay. Um, I'm an artist. I'm here. Governor's, uh, I'm on Governor's Island. I'm in a residency right now. [indistinct chatter] Okay. Alright. Um. Do it. I'm your favorite artist. You just met your favorite artist. Your favorite artist? Yeah. You've been around? What's your name? I'm Sam. [indistinct chatter] No formalities. It's so weird. Are you like, imagining like, you're an artist. Like, it would be like, it would be like literally Leonardo da Vinci in Florence right now. Yeah. And literally some kid coming up and be like, he's like, I'm an artist. He would be like, oh, you're an artist? Yeah. And then I'm like asking the second kid that I need a phone. No, sir. No, sir. I did not take a picture. Sure way. Sorry. Okay, sure. What did you do? Why did you take a phone? Well, my head fence were connected and I wanted to pause the music. I was like, sorry. I'm like, I'm a classic. I'm your artist. I could draw like that when I was a baby. You can't do that. You could draw like that when you were a baby. You can draw too, bro. No, certainly not. I'm not a good searcher. Yeah, you have a residency in Europe. Where'd you go? Harvard and all that shit? No, no, no, no. Where are you from? Scandinavia? Indiana. I knew it. Not everyone's nice from Indiana. Are you from the Midwest as well? No, but I'm Celtic, which means you're kind of connected to the world. Okay. Like, I'm goodwill hunting. You can't see that in me. Goodwill hunting. You've been here for two days. What's going on? No, I've been here months. Months. What, how, Indiana? You're just from Indiana School of Liberal Arts or something? No, I went to school for Liberal Arts. And Calamity. Calamity, Michigan. Oh my God. Yeah. Shit. And you just... And you have a fucking residency when I don't. There's something fucking wrong with work because I'm legally blind and you're not. You are blind. So you can go like this. Go, go, go. Every fucking person in this thing can pass me all day. You're the only one who's up to the art world. Oh. And by the way, it's just... Did you just shrug off to my main point? No, no, no. My point is that no one gives a shit about art or artists. And I'm an actual humanitarian artist. It's the only kind of artist we have in the world. Unless you're just a narcissist, a dope, talented, douchebag. Right? So the only artists are the people who are being humanitarian. Where'd you get this? Do you remember? I don't know. I don't know. Imagine if you met Andy Warhol and you're like, instead of focusing on Andy, you're literally looking at one of Andy's books in the studio. Like when I met him... I don't know. But like... Alright, what's your contact? How do you deal with him? This is old-fashioned, like some point. Yeah, yeah, okay. My number is 765-401. Probably. I'm not blind. I have strabismus. I'm being hardy to ensure that I'm controlling. N6701. My name is Sam... D. I have a special last name. D. Yeah, there you go. That's right. Oh, thank you. What's your email address? I don't really use my email that much. Just give me a text or... I'm not gonna... I don't type. Don't text? Samuel Dalma. Samuel... Yeah. D-O-U-M-A. @gmail.com. Got it. Alright, so this Governor's Island, so what did you... Who did you talk to? Who's the person that grants the grant? And how long is it for? Well, I can... No, but I'm not... I'm not... Honestly, I don't do this. I do this or this. I do this. Yeah. So what's the... I know, people have told me I'll go to the Governor's Island's residence. Let's go to the governor. But who's the person? There's no specific person. I don't even know much. I really haven't been in town for long, but... What I mean, like, how long is it for? Listen, I work mostly digitally, so just... I don't. I'm blind. Okay. Do you have any way of emailing? Why do you want my email? No, just in case if I have a secretary. I'm blind. Well, I recommend checking... Check out the governor's island stuff, okay? Yeah, but how long is it for? It's all summer, pretty much. What do you mean? How long is the longest one? I don't really know. What do you mean? I don't understand how this works. I... What do you mean? It goes until, like, August or something. And when did it start? A couple weeks ago, I don't know. I haven't been in town long. Oh, and how did you... What did you do to get it? I just went to school and at Kalamazoo College, and they're attached to this thing. Oh, I see. Yeah. So are you teaching or something about it? Yeah. And what does it provide you? Oh, it just, you know, gets me out there, gets me making stuff. No, what does it provide you? Space. A space to do what? Whatever I need to. But what? All right, what else? What do you mean? That's about it. That's why I'm so vague about all this, is because it's really just a space that was given to me by, like, the subsidized arts of the island. Like, I don't really know a whole lot involved. Like, they do this with a bunch of people. And what's that person thing? I don't know. What... I mean, so what is it? Governor's Island Arts is what you should be. I gotta get off. No, but I mean, do they put you up? No, they don't put you up. Put me up? Yeah. What does that mean? Oh, you mean like galleries? No. You said they give you, like, a studio space? Yeah, that's it. Like, do they put you up? So... What does that mean? Where do you live? Oh, do they give you a space? No, you have to find your own space. And where do you... Like, how did you get that to live? Huh? How do you live? Oh, I just live with this pair of artists that I, that I, you know, have known from earlier school. From back there? Yeah. And you guys all just decided to come in? Yeah. You should give it a look sometime. It was great talking to you, though. I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to see the whole thing. I don't know. Do you think they're gonna be able to see it? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. You know, earlier somebody asked me like, if I've ever gotten scared while recording, like, it gets sketchy. That's the first time it's ever happened. I really couldn't make my way out of that conversation. I was genuinely comfortable. I come down here. We're on audio. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Was that person dangerous? Should I have stopped interacting with them sooner? Was I doing a very dangerous thing by going up to a paranoid individual who is clearly in a heightened state and desperate for a location but completely off the grid? A frightening man selling art books on the high line? A scary man. But using the arts as his form of thievery or fuckery. [Music] [Music] Yeah, I feel scary the way you have to navigate this set of controversies, whether or not it's okay to record the private things and share them in art. What is candid and what is a violation of privacy among the social agreement? [Music] Don't give too much information. You're naive. You could be fucking... You do. Breaking... The rules of society. That was truly a scary man. My adrenaline is still coming down. I should flee the area.
