A real anthropologist becomes concernedwith the whole corpus of humanity and thuslife itself, and so as naturally happens in thefield of knowledge—a proper anthropologistmust be a historian, and a proper historianmust be a scientist to study the dawn of life,the causal chain of events, and such thescientist must eventually fall into chemistry,and a proper chemist occupies a field basedon physics and must become a physicist,which to become a proper physicist onemust occupy philosophy and philosophycan’t stand without faith and faith can not beachieved without art. And so anthropology isindirectly aesthetic and religious, despite itfeeling founded on the firm ‘ground rules’ ofthe universe.Each field depends on the other- notbecause it is a key to unlock a new door, butbecause there is precisely no threshold asthe boundaries are inextricably based oneach other. All knowledge, information andperceived reality, in this way, is fundamentallyand indubitably distilled into a unified field/substance.because there is precisely no threshold asthe boundaries are inextricably based oneach other. All knowledge, information andperceived reality, in this way, is fundamentallyand indubitably distilled into a unified field/substance.Clouds of this unified entity will changeforms and require various energies tobecome nothing more than a thing in itself,for itself, and will never bridge the leap to bethat symbol it is mapped to via language.And so- for the experimenters andinformation handlers, the creatives, thefaithful, the hopeful, and the insane, flourish itproudly that you are an untethered agentwho needs no sincere label for any bit of fluxthat deceives you as constancy. This is, weare, it is soup and steam and a fractalinesalad.StopI am still fragile, and frailI am still fragile, and frailThe habit is to find wires which rununderneath the base of my physiology,and to correct themThis means that even if the surface ofmy existence is rippled and waving andstorming,My warm currents pulse on, gently andwith unchanging strengthThere must be a foundation for a houseto stand through the gusts of timeOur world swims with lives of flotsamand jetsamThey never find the dryness of landLet me be an islandFor no man is an islandAnd I wish not to be Just a Man.We have few senses in the world ofmuch stimulus— few ways toexperienceYet I must cover my ears in silence, forit holds too much noiseYet I burst speakers because sound isnot loud enoughL'éternel féminin, das Ewig-Weibliche,Helen of Troy– she which we oughtrevereIs that which is outside of the humanrealm of ignorance and confusionOur lips will never meet, yet Idaydream of her, write her, speak toherPray to her, breathe her atoms whichtoddle around the atmosphereI offer a sacrifice to her; my humanbody.I offer a sacrifice to her; my humanbody.Take my body and all that may or maynot reside in itits busy halls of blood cells, its inwardeye, its chemical fearlet it fall in the space between mold andloamcracks of phosphorus and dressed upmen who failed at living foreverFeed me to the Earth through themouth of fauna, and through the rootsof life born after my endDo not honor me in the shallow way ofMen, forget my name, and insteadbreathe Her air,for I never left her arms, nor will I.I am not the start nor the end of herI am not the start nor the end of herLike her, I will carry on, doing what I dobest: driftingThe same action I took while walking,just less complicatedI was born drifting, and will die drifting.That's all I know, and all I will know.I shall not fail to revel in hermovements, I have married her,And I am her; her who I shall nevermeet.
