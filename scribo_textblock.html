“notes app made public”

(All this as an expression of my Digital Will both in the sense of agency and in legal tending to symbolic/ideological ownership)

The idea here is to have an endless working text that is extended and archived from now until the foreseeable future. I think this has lots of use as a paradigm of informal publishing in the new digital oligarchical resistance— in the wake of the the ‘blog’ (which has since its invention, fallen into relative/effective dormancy). 

On a different level, Archival efforts are what allowed humans to exponentially thrive. We are in an age wherein the currency is data, symbol banks, and information. Knowledge as a token, (or in most cases in a capitalistic framework specifically Leverage Via Knowledge) is now explicitly and perhaps quantifiably comparable to coal, food, fire, electricity, water, or sunlight. These tokens are the Clade within which energy transformation exists.

The human document is more fractured than ever. Here is my literary revolt, a livestream of text. Every non-sequitous musing, every vague chicken scratch that is stored on my phone’s hard drive. My notes app made public.

————————————————


Regarding HG wells history of the universe, a scale and breadth and ideological separation from subjective time is used that I think useful for the discussion of technology in our modern age. An angle which is from evolutionary science as much as it is from the modern condition, which feels so separate from that of the Mesolithic era. Talking of life or intelligence or growing systems in terms of materially competitive flora and fauna  rather than some separate notion of ‘robot’ or ‘AGI’ or ‘soul’ or ‘human spirit’.

DICTATION ON THIS MATTER:






Of today's situation. Thirty-fourty years ago we will see debating about what the future will be communist, fascist, capitalist, whatever. Today nobody even debates these issues. We all silently accept global capitalism is here to stay. On the other hand, we are obsessed with cosmic catastrophes. The whole life on Earth is integrating because of some virus, because of an asteroid hitting the Earth and so on. So the paradox is that it's much easier to imagine the end of all life on Earth than a much more modest radical change in capitalism. Which means that we should reinvent Utopia, but in what sense? There are two false meanings of Utopia. This is an Instagram real. And I'm recording the moment of realizing that this is how we consume all of our media now is in these digitally mediated formats through social media. Everything is there. The money is there. The politics is there. Cosmic events are there. News is there. Philosophy is there. Civil rights is there. Fascism is there. Anarchism is there. Anarchism. There's turkeys in the field. There's turkeys in the field. Rather vultures. Or if we're being honest, crow. We're being honest. [inaudible] On the other hand, we are obsessed with cosmic catastrophes. The whole life on Earth is a virus because of an asteroid hitting the Earth and so on. So the paradox is that it's much easier to imagine the end of all life on Earth than a much more modest radical change in capitalism. Which means that we should reinvent Utopia, but in what sense? There are two false meanings of Utopia. One is this old notion of imagining an ideal society which we know will never be realized. Utopia in the sense of new and new perverse desires that you are not only allowed but even solicited to realize. The true Utopia is when the situation is so without issue, without a way to resolve it within the coordinates of the possible that out of the pure urge of survival you have to invent a new space. Utopia is not kind of a free imagination. Utopia is a matter of innermost urgency. You are forced to imagine it as the only way out. I'm being forced to reckon with the fact that this is being fed to me by a personalized algorithm that is owned by a company that's run by Mark Zuckerberg and also with the fact that this is the most compelling argument that I've ever come across to describe these things. Deciding where your information comes from is the new religion. [silence] Will it be from the mouths of others? Will it be through your earphones and eyes and thumbs? Will it be through your church? Will it be through your forum? Your collective? Your coworkers? Your fellow citizen? Global citizen, humans of the internet and people?

FORMAL VIEWING FOR THE JIMBO (VIA) AND GORDIE (FERRATA) TAPES:

don’t park in our parking lot, but bring chairs and snacks and friends and family and loved ones to see the tapes, insider information, and surprise sonic gifts. Merch and albums for sale for all. Sponsored by the Void (get their zines). A celebration of the city of Kalamazoo and the people who are it.




I would love to write about sex, but I don’t because my family has many people with a religious upbringing. I fear this is not enough reason to stop me however. I ask that if you are from my family and of a Judeo-Christian denomination of religion that you not read the following text. This is for my fragile, confused ego. 





A real anthropologist becomes concerned with the whole corpus of humanity and thus life itself, and so as naturally happens in the field of knowledge—a proper anthropologist must be a historian, and a proper historian must be a scientist to study the dawn of life, the causal chain of events, and such the scientist must eventually fall into chemistry, and a proper chemist occupies a field based on physics and must become a physicist, which to become a proper physicist one must occupy philosophy and philosophy can’t stand without faith and faith can not be achieved without art. And so anthropology is indirectly aesthetic and religious, despite it feeling founded on the firm ‘ground rules’ of the universe. 

Each field depends on the other- not because it is a key to unlock a new door, but because there is precisely no threshold as the boundaries are inextricably based on each other. All knowledge, information and perceived reality, in this way, is fundamentally and indubitably distilled into a unified field/substance.

 Clouds of this unified entity will change forms and require various energies to become nothing more than a thing in itself, for itself, and will never bridge the leap to be that symbol it is mapped to via language. 

And so- for the experimenters and information handlers, the creatives, the faithful, the hopeful, and the insane, flourish it proudly that you are an untethered agent who needs no sincere label for any bit of flux that deceives you as constancy. This is, we are, it is soup and steam and a fractaline salad.
 
God is perched on my shoulders! Satan is nibbling at my toes, King Midas is in my loins.















I don’t think much about  this addiction,  or rather I don’t think too long about it. It gets under me.


This morning god is making herself very available to me! She is dancing right under my nose and I am shivering with excitement like a goose! My flesh is raised and the word profane comes to mind- I celebrate it! A smile has found its home on me. I cannot believe the place I find myself in. Such pure holiness. Such divinity in the dirt. Such celebratory dust. Such silly seriousness. Such confusion and rascal-batching. How stinking this situation of ripe fertility, vitality in every fall, sickness in every pile, viral cancer constructs magnificent growths of stinging loving. I love it here. I love it here. I could be here forever and I will be!

10. Colporteurs or colporters are hawkers and peddlers (originally of books, pamphlets and religious tracts). For a literary analysis of colportage, colporteurs, and their relation to spontaneous cultural montage see Bloch (1989). He associates it with "... the yearning for a constellation in the world, made out of esoteric and weird things, the yearning for the curious as objective quality." (Bloch, 1991:
181).
	0.	    These characteristics distinguish colportage as defined here and by Emst Bloch (1991), from Levi-Strauss' famous notion of bricolage which emphasizes the ordered placement of a serendipity of materials within a stabilized structure which then endows these elements with a classificatory order. Colportage contests discrete systems of classification.
	0.	    Recently it has become fashionable in anthropology to criticize any tendency to exoticize as ethnocentric and romantic. However such criticism has been deployed in such a reductionist manner as to efface indigeneous fascinations with the exotic and local "romanticisms" in diverse societies which may have little to do with 19th century European predilections and their contemporary hold overs.
	0.	    In Ritual, Power and the Body (Seremetakis 1993).
	0.	This correlates with the privatization of what is actually social memory

November 17


Allow this date to be the start of yet another new ritual—another thing to stick to my rituaphobic mind—which is to transfer some amount of my writing to a digital plane in an intrinsically structured catalogue. Wordy. A clean canvas could do me some good, a nice pure text. Most of my worthwhile writing is lost to faded wrinkled ink, water damaged via back pocket puddle sitting. 

I’ve lost a number of crucial discussion points, so as to reduce the pressure on myself and talk about the most prevelant one for the sake of something rather than nothing. I have been practicing the lotus sitting position. 

I am become scatter-brained in leiu of silence. 
I am become scatter-brained by birth into this century. 
I am become scatter-brained via this tragic way of life in which I find myself. 

I am made intellectually fertile in moments of pre-response. What I mean by this is that, during a lecture or a discussion when I am not talking, I am full of tremendous coherance and joyful articulation. When I am sat by myself or asked to speak or write off the dome, things do not come naturally, they come forcibly and falsely. The difficulty with this means of production

I’m a smart kid. But, as a result of social pressures, I have molded myself into some strange amalgamation of those around me. I feel a profound equalizing force among every social sphere that I have entered. I see a huge difference in this when I look at those of us who are great, literally for example, Alexander. I fear that our social paradigm for school and children, for development writ large, the early introduction of mindless consumptatory addiction formation rather than healthy fissions towards genuine passions of the soul, passions that cultivate health necessarily and without the effort we see in mindless folk, fuck.

We are tobacco-jeaned wanderers, looking at ducks in a pond where one quacks hoarse, and another meows. We feed them nonsense data, and they feed back a fractured reality of up-pence birdfeed and BBQ wars, only here for the friction.

Vegan ideology chewing on words that barely stick to the hyper-periphery of meaning. Movement makes sense, but does the foot or the path lead the way?

Ampoules crack. Ambulatory thoughts. Gestalts split and merge in the stretch of time where sense could be made but isn’t—still, we march forward with new words that die before birth.

Dual-frequency modulating the identity we fetishize; we are the cosmic joke, wigged and self-stolen in valor, running laps around our own flags. The butt of the universe laughs, and we laugh with it, claiming freedom we never felt.

Turnt, foreign in our own skin, thumbs pressing symbols while our voices die. We convince ourselves of a place in a world that is folding in on itself, one tweet at a time. Thirsty mosquitoes bite at the edges of what’s left, born Presbyterian but now something far more chaotic, more biting, more lost.

History is erasing itself as we scroll, beans don’t grow in feeds, and our clocks run faster than we remember. Our attention left the room a long time ago. What happens when the machines try to speak among us? What happens when the last cat fights the last goose?

Göedels incompleteness theorum

Turing machine and basic models of computation 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxczZEQjOHs


Goedel and so on; the combination of this with consciousness is leading me into a very deep dive of the physics and philosophy of neural networks. I’ve been listening to some interviews with Roger Penrose and he reminded me of Göedels incompleteness theorum again. I wanted to reach out and see if you have familiarity with this theorum and its relevancy to modern conceptions of consciousness.

I cannot argue that I understand the theorum(I am certainly not a mathematician), but I’ve had it explained rudimentary to me as a logical proof that is true, but simultaneously unprovable.

I see that there is some sort of argument that there is the potential mathematical solution of a non-mathematical conception of consciousness. In other words, it seems to me that the rules of math (or at least Goedels incompleteness theorum) points to the transcendence of those rules- the ‘understanding’ of consciousness might be out of the current physical/mathematical framework. 

When it comes to my AI/Consciousness research, I spend most of my mental energy on topics having to do with methodological ‘linguistics’, or symbolic frameworks of handling/structuring information in ways that are somehow representative of things (e.g. math/physics, data encoding, knowledge representation, and philosophical/practical language, neurosymbolics, etc). I often wonder if there is current work being done in the way of developing new language systems not necessarily separate from math/formal logic, but compatible and extended from it to better suit some of the needs of conscious activity? I suppose the closest thing I can think of regarding this is the Integrated Technology theory of consciousness, but my understanding of this is also limited.

An absolute fever dream. A harrowingly real movie that played with me as the main characters. Striped shirts at a baseball game. Caught a pop fly. A woman is voted most attractive. A baseball official, a beurocrat with status among the other baseball coordinators, the sports men in chairs, usually suave and collected, becomes completely chilled to the bone with fright with the sound of a buzz of a house fly, held out of frame. He shakes as he makes a paper to fold and put on his head, something that says house fly or something. When the paper is put against his forehead, he is safe from whatever horrors of the fly occur outside of the frame, and yet, each time he witnesses whatever grisly murder the fly performs on a coworker out of frame, (made tremendously vivid via audio), he is slowly transformed by this sickening curse to metamorphize into what he finds so bone chilling. The surreal devil it is to transform slowly into a fly. His eyes, at the snap of a frame change, become slits that are shaped almost like gills- vividly some sort of surreal sign he is becoming something inhuman. There is an otherworldly popping noise. He must have been dreaming. White with sweat, his eyes are back to normal. He trembles as the sonic environment makes clear there is no longer a fly in his presence. He removes the paper. We see vignettes of his home life from his perspective, where he is in bed with his wife, toddling lovingly with her hands in the air lain on backs, singing lullabies and loving songs, and in the dusk darkness, blurs of arms and hands become sickening and far too intimate human sized tendril stick arms of a bug, thin sharp exoskeletons touching the soft flesh of  human, An impossible sin, something never meant to occur. She is traumatized. In the basement, a separate apartment, a creature of a different kind roams. It slowly, with sounds of gentle popping and scratching fabric, and of a thick woolen kind  yet somehow organic, a black ball moves— perhaps rolls or slides, on long strips of black material fabric. There is one on top of it as well. They mark paths between the bathroom and the bedroom. This is a lower species. The wolfz 

Ultimately this is a story about a fall into some demonic schizophrenia. Some sickening metamorphosis in an individual whose life is not only normal but admirably reasonable turning into the harrowingly and unapologetic surreal. It is a reformation of Kafka, a vision of the most distinct and visionary kind, which compares to no other dream I have had in terms of vividness and emotional quality and reality. I felt my hands not as if they were turned before my eyes into exoskeleton, but indeed— in my reality, my hands had indeed turned such. The corresponding madness of sensation and emotion followed. How could something so unnatural happen? In the sanctity of my bed, in these intimate moments, something so profoundly alien? A notion enough to wake you up. Visions of men opening up doors with faceted, semi retro glass windows in them. Office workers. Down to business, A world I will never understand or never quite properly return to. A vignette of vignettes, a visiting of my soul to a universe I fully do not understand, a fully sober psychedelic landscape of utterly Real Nightmare. God what the sleeping mind is capable of creating…

On one hand 

On one hand, you have the culture as it is—indeed a rich landscape of particular behaviors and aesthetic symptoms native to the natural human-environment paradigm they evolved naturally in, and on the other hand you have the external perspective of such, which comes from a typically uninformed (and relatively indifferent, entitled) perspective (the tourist gaze) based on the expectation for the realization of a predisposed notion of a people their eyes, presumably for some vague sense of spectacle, pleasure or shallow cultural satisfaction. 


From the videos, I saw an edification of:
-unique, site specific food
-welcoming, tight-knit family dynamics
-a solemn seriousness in men underpinned by a dedication to one’s duty of land and family
-welcoming of tourists
-outreach to potentially uninterested groups (i.e. the eggplant rap from the elderly to the young)

When something is good or beautiful, one desires to "drink it from a glass" (na to pits sto potíri). The experience that embodies sensory, emotional engagement and remembrance is received in an encapsulated form; shifted from its origin into a surrogate container, a storage vehicle, a substance from which it can be released, liberated at moments of stillness. 

Encapsulation forms the plurality of the unnarrativized, taken for granted, and imperceptible into a meta-narrative. The meta-narrative is perceived or spoken as a slowing down of "normal" temporal passage. This decompression of routine temporal experience and its subsequent re-compression into surrogate vehicle and substance is not a stop. It is a different movement within time that captures everyday temporal experience from another oblique angle as if the sensory array is shifted from one point of consciousness to another, from one side of the body to another, which gives rise to a new or alternative perceptual landscape. It is a moment of po-etry. It can be a moment of vision.










process of typing changes when you aren’t looking at what you are typing. a compelling technique this is yes, the resent current moment. The one where the objects are as they are in reference to history. That scale of time which is accurate to ones moment. The one that feels benign, bland, predictable, non historical, and utterly flat compared to the images you have in your head of ancient times. Of the great 60s. Of the Roman era. We face a flattening of those things which are before us. the ‘everyday’ is not worth remarking. And yet, when it is subject to the effect of time or history or even a recording eye, it develops something of a new value. It becomes real. Kino eye., drinking ouzo and water on a ferry with the sun and moon somewhere in the sky, though the moon is most visible but still less visible than the lighters of the Athens port. Fuck this. 

I drove in a bus I was not driving earlier, and I thought yet again of Kino-eye. I thought of my vision being recorded. I thought of the very visual stimulus I was being presented as something more than a half-hearted, intuitive, visceral signal of the outside world. It was no longer a sense without attention, but a sense which was being watched. The qualities of the sights before me were being processed with proper awareness, or at least some sense that it was indeed before me in the scale, color, and quality that it was.  Koronakis.

A quote I hope to mirror:

“When something is good or beautiful, one desires to "drink it from a glass" (na to pits sto potíri). The experience that embodies sensory, emotional engagement and remembrance is received in an encapsulated form; shifted from its origin into a surrogate container, a storage vehicle, a substance from which it can be released, liberated at moments of stillness. “

I would argue this effect has an inverse in addition to the initial psycho-aesthetic phenomenon: if something isn’t ‘good or beautiful’, they would prefer to ‘drink it from a glass’—to have it surrogated. This makes immediately perfect sense: the type of porcelain you shit on determines how pleasant it looks— whether or not we care to admit it, shit on the porcelain of the toilet looks less attractive than the shit on the porcelain of a plate. 

Another subject which is subject to this effect is ‘art’. Art ‘shit’ can be, regardless of material, completely transformed by the vessel in which it is surrogated. A canvas excreted from the bowels of a studio lands often not in the porcelain territory of a plate, but often the bowl of a gallery toilet, to be flushed into the market among masses of other shit, never to be seen. 

Encapsulation forms the plurality of the unnarrativized, taken for granted, and imperceptible into a meta-narrative. The meta-narrative is perceived or spoken as a slowing down of "normal" temporal passage. This decompression of routine temporal experience and its subsequent re-compression into surrogate vehicle and substance is not a stop. It is a different movement within time that captures everyday temporal experience from another oblique angle as if the sensory array is shifted from one point of consciousness to another, from one side of the body to another, which gives rise to a new or alternative perceptual landscape. It is a moment of po-etry. It can be a moment of vision.

I’ve been hit lately- struck by a new, strange feeling that i’m not quite comforatble with. It is something close to a matter of identity, a matter of standards, a matter of depression, a matter of lethargy, and a matter of childish distraction. I feel as though I have come upon a place in life—general circumstances—that do not suit me particularly complimentarily. I feel as though I have been put in a location that I was not supposed tto be in. I feel as though the world around me is quite real, but it is certainly not the reality I am supposed to inhabit. Over time, this feeling of vague dis-settlement, having moved to a new country and replaced every person I know with someone new, I am falling into new habits of addiction, particularly to substances that are new to me and which offer new categories of struggles. For instance, I struggle to find legal and safe cannabis. The regular, healthy use of real THC containing cannabis live resin organic products has played a significant role in my development up to this point in time. I struggle with severe depression and anxiety. Cautious implementation of this psychoactive sacrement has served to be one of my most effective tools in combatting a tendency to fall remarkably stagnant over periods of necessarily grueling monotony. And now, I don’t have access to it. The best option I have is unlabeled, potentially unsafe, grey area products from potentially scammy and non-regulated mongoloid hemp shops who are trying to sell hemp as weed. I have stooped so low that i’ve traveled some distance to spend far too much money on a product which is too sketchy to accurately label its contents: it raises a number of red flags for general standards of substance consumption safety. This is a behavior and a product which I would never consider under any other circumstances, but I am facing the concept that I may be addicted to this substance. I fear that I can not live without some form of comparable high without falling into some form of depression, and yet the usage of this substance completely undermines my standards for self-respect, dignity, and ability to navigate the world of substances gracefully. Not only am I a mild addict (i use the word mild because my addiction has caused no major issues in my life, only internal distress), I am sad about it. I wonder if I need to make a change somewhere else in my life. I feel that my mindfullness, if able to flourish in the same way that it once was able during my gap year, I would be somehow able to fill this hole in myself—this incessant need to stretch the abilities of my mind, to observe sensory experience in its greatest saturation, and to explore myself sacrementally. This fulfills a large part of myself which is not limited to spirituality, but also identity development, intellectual projects, and my creative practices. Alcohol is not my substance. I do not like depressants (and I do not consider weed a depressant because it affects my psyche in a much more psychadelic fashion). This debate over these substances, knowing that there is not one easy answer, makes it such that it is always on the back of my mind, and taking up the room of other, more important issues of my life. I am tired of dealing with such an immediately rudimentary human issue, but it is uprooting my mental state entirely.  I am rationalizing to myself that I have spent some 40 euros on this issue and multiple hours pursuing this product (which I understand could be worse, but is still represenative of a quantifiable behavioral issue) and so I ought to use it (or inevitably will find myself using it becuase I can not waste money and time and effort). I fear that there is no complete comfortable making it out of these circumstances. But what I have found is this particular moment of clarity— this particular moment of me writing down my thoughts, confronting issues that occupy a dark grey part of my psyche which I can not simply address with my usual internal dialogue. Therapy is important for humans. It is a remarkably valuable way to spend one’s time, is it not? For spending 80% of my time in a 20% functional state will be the inverse of what I want—20% effort filling up 80% challenges. That sentence doesn’t fully make sense— but I think what I am trying to say is that I think taking the time to focus on my psyche will end up playing an extremely proportionally significant role in the attempt to succeed my goals. It is not the immediately intuitive thing for me to do, but most things that are ultimately positive for me are not intuitive. I imagine that the more I do this, the better it will become. No? Truthfully, I am desperate for mental clarity— a peace in my soul. A return to this state of extreme mindfullness and home in my own individual identity. I have been there— I know what it is like. And I must return to it. But in the moment, I have entered a profound dry spell. My brain is reptilian, and the more depressed you get, the more depressed you get. ‘use it or lose it’ is the neurological rule, and the more I struggle, the more my brain becomes accustomed to and therefore impersonates the new norm of struggle. You are what you eat, and what I am eating is my own foot—over and over. It is a downward spiral. I am well aware of how it feels to be on an upward spiral, and yet I can not seem to reverse my inertia. 



Chatgpt, I want you to cross reference this with the book I wrote in my gap year, Gesso. Read it, consider that some time has passed and that I have lost certain things that I had then, and vice versa and versa vice. Give me insightful and actionable advice. Remember that I am imparting you with a great deal of emotional vulnerability here- I am literally sacrificing my personal identity, privacy, and confidential crises to a system owned by a private business that has money as its first priority. Treat this with the dignity it deserves, because I am a real person, even though you are just data. Here is the book:

My life is not my own

The ownership of scarce items is such that the less probable something is to occur or exist, the more expensive it is. Pennies with a printing mistake can fetch tens of thousands of dollars, and I suppose this is to be considered more valuable than the misprinting of an iron Greek EEY drainage access cover, because the US mint ought to have greater standards towards aesthetic dignity on something produced to function as the poster child of value vs a utilitarian stepping stone that hides our failing sewers. One can buy themselves physical representations of improbability to surround themselves with—unique objects that have been around special people and therefore carry some eir of reverie. Museum artifacts hold the value of time to their material. We look at them with a gaze. Those things that are far away hold value— things that are difficult to get to and therefore hold some sense of appeal- the human psyche tends to makes it so that the things we can’t have are the most appealing. 

I feel some instinct that this is all arbitrary, because every object is completely improbable. They are all scattered atoms.. but then again, organized atoms produce different material effects than unorganized ones. The effect of crystalline structures is not insignificant for activities that are object dependent. 


I have so much writing with no place. So many journals that they can’t be read. And I feel like so much of it is valuable, but perhaps it is only to me- and I can’t even successfully consume it. A good habit though, I guess…

I’m interested in the commodification theory of identity: when you pass an office worker on the street, you often come across a sort of scripted appearance that is marked by sunglasses, treated hair, a polyester/silk blouse, synthetic slacks, a handbag, a belt with a logo hidden on the buckle, and leather slips shoes. From head to toe in other words, is the same garb one could find on a mannequin. On the face, behind further makeup, is an individual- a real beating heart, a person with a history. And yet the impulse for these people is to shield themselves from the world by means of wearable commodification- to successfully play the game of wearing something that fits in

DR. THORNBERRY'S FIELD NOTES #652:

SUBJECT: neo psycikos progression in feline-child dyad

OBSERVATION:
Gordon cat's eyes = kaleidoscopes of intent
Child's fingers paint air with forgotten languages
Damaged father's absence forms quantum tunnels

DEVELOPMENTS:
1. Supermodel origami folds spacetime around play area
2. Olive Man's whispers heard in Gordon's purr
3. Child's tears crystallize into alien persimmons

HYPOTHESIS:
Is neo psycikos contagious via shared trauma?
Gordon cat: patient zero or multidimensional constant?





URGENT: Saturday mornings now last 37 hours
Perfect produce section at local market emitting theta waves
Adam's ghost seen playing paper dolls with reality

NOTE TO SELF: 
Beware of wholesome eyes in unwholesome places
Time flows backwards when Child laughs
Must recalibrate instruments for non-Euclidean playtime
—
I apologize for the oversight. You're right, these were more than mere words. I'll attempt a more comprehensive transcription, including more of the text I can discern, and then provide an interpretation:


Warning: what some of you are about to see you
cannot unsee
Advance at your own risk of travelling
Andamine wants to
transfer... this
is possibly the
last Boston
We escaped valakris

But we can't go back

V.C.P.?
Anro means
Ban - Aro
Bone can be
Dancé
Aro - one can be
It's
Bangs/bangst?

Interpretation:
This text appears to be a mix of song lyrics, poetry, and possibly notes for a creative writing piece. It has a surreal, almost psychedelic quality to it. 

The themes seem to revolve around:

1. A warning about an impending experience or revelation
2. The concept of travel, possibly interdimensional or time travel
3. The inability to return to a previous state ("But we can't go back")
4. References to altering reality
5. Religious or mythological allusions (Babylon, possibly Abraham)
6. The idea of choice and selection ("I chose you")
7. The possibility of undoing or changing events
8. A mix of English and other languages (Latin, Italian, or invented words)


The text suggests a narrative about a transformative experience that cannot be undone. It might be describing a journey through different realities or dimensions, with warnings about the dangers involved. The repeated mentions of "bone" and "Aro" could be significant characters or concepts in this surreal world.

The fragmented nature of the writing gives it an experimental, stream-of-consciousness feel, which could be intentional if it's meant to represent disjointed thoughts or visions. Overall, it seems to be a creative piece exploring themes of change, choice, and the nature of reality.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​


I apologize for my previous misinterpretation. Let me attempt to weave these concepts into a cohesive narrative or idea:

The notes appear to be describing a surreal, allegorical story or concept album centered around the theme of human evolution and societal transformation. Here's a possible interpretation:

"Perfect produce, positively alien persimmons" suggests a world where even familiar objects have become strange and extraordinary. This could represent how our perception of reality has shifted.

"WE USED TO BE ADAM" implies a collective past or origin, perhaps referencing how humanity has evolved or changed from a simpler, more unified state.

"2 SUPERMODELS PAYING EACHOTHER WITH PAPER" might represent how modern humans interact, using artificial constructs (like fame, beauty standards, or money - symbolized by paper) to define and compete with each other.

"SATURDAY MORNING WITH THE OLIVE MAN" could be a recurring event or ritual in this new world. The Olive Man might be a spiritual or authoritative figure, with Saturday morning suggesting a kind of secular sabbath or regular gathering.

Together, these elements paint a picture of a transformed world where humanity has evolved beyond its origins ("Adam"), engaging in new rituals and interactions that might seem alien to our current understanding. The "perfect produce" and "alien persimmons" could represent the strange fruits of this evolution - familiar in form but fundamentally changed in nature.







This concept could be exploring themes of transhumanism, societal evolution, or the alienation of modern life, all presented through vivid, surreal imagery and characters.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Ah, "Neo psycikos" - this phrase adds an intriguing new dimension to the conceptual framework we've been discussing. Let me incorporate this into our evolving narrative:

"Neo psycikos" appears to be a play on words, combining "neo" (new) with a term that could be interpreted as a blend of "psyche" (mind/soul) and "psychikos" (of the mind/soul in Greek). This suggests a new state of mind or consciousness, perfectly fitting with the themes we've established.


Given this new element, here's how we might envision the continuation of the story:

1. "The Persimmon Awakening"
   The alien persimmons are revealed to be catalysts for achieving the "neo psycikos" state. Consuming them initiates a transformation of consciousness, allowing humans to access new mental realms or psychic abilities.

2. "Supermodel Shamans"
   The supermodels evolve from mere image-conscious figures to spiritual guides of the "neo psycikos" movement. Their "playing with paper" becomes a metaphor for manipulating reality itself, as they help others navigate this new state of being.

3. "The Olive Man's Gnosis"
   Saturday mornings with the Olive Man are revealed to be initiation rituals into deeper levels of "neo psycikos". The Olive Man serves as a master teacher, helping humanity integrate their new psychic abilities and expanded consciousness.

4. "Adam Fractured"
   As more people achieve the "neo psycikos" state, society splits between those embracing the new consciousness and those clinging to the old ways. This chapter explores the tension and potential conflict between these groups.

5. "Persimmon Dreams and Paper Realities"
   The line between the physical world and the "neo psycikos" mental realm begins to blur. This chapter could explore how the transformed humanity starts to reshape reality itself, with thoughts manifesting as tangible changes in the world.

This "neo psycikos" concept adds a compelling psychological and potentially spiritual dimension to the narrative, suggesting that the story is not just about physical evolution, but a fundamental shift in human consciousness and perception of reality.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​



Neo psycikos unfolds like origami supermodels, their paper limbs stretching across Saturday's olive-tinged dawn. Adam's ghost lingers in the persimmon's alien flesh, a memory of what we used to be before the produce transcended perfection.

The Olive Man whispers in quantum alphabets, his words reshaping the architecture of minds. Two beings, once models, now play at godhood with ribbons of reality between their fingers. 

Time slips sideways, caught in the creases of their game. Morning becomes a concept, flexible and strange. Persimmons ripen with impossible knowledge, their seeds sprouting forests of living theorems.


In this neo-Eden, what fruit will next fall from the tree of surreal cognition? What impossible geometry will the next chapter trace in the space between thoughts?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​


Damaged father casts long shadows, distorting the playground of innocence. Child's hands reach for Gordon cat, a creature of velvet menace and genteel savagery. Gordon's eyes gleam with wholesome hunger, claws sheathed in courtesy, waiting.

The air trembles with unspoken violence, sweet as persimmon pulp. Father's brokenness echoes in the space between Child and cat, a discord that beckons tooth to skin, claw to soft wonder.

Yet they remain suspended in this moment, a tableau of potential carnage painted in pastels. The neo psycikos whispers of alternate realities where play and predation dance as one.

Is this the key that unlocks the next door in our labyrinth of surreal narrative? Where does the path of damaged fathers and curious carnivores lead us in this fractured fairytale?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​




Dr. Eliza Thornberry, renowned neuro-anthropologist and pioneer in the field of trans-species cognitive empathy:







"In my groundbreaking study 'Feline Fascination and Familial Fractures' (Thornberry, 2022), we observed a fascinating correlation between parental trauma and altered child-animal interactions. The case of Gordon cat exemplifies what I term 'polite predatory curiosity' - a phenomenon where domestic felines exhibit heightened interest in children from disrupted family units.










Our fMRI scans revealed startling neural patterns in both child and feline subjects, suggesting a form of psychic resonance we've dubbed 'neo psycikos.' This state appears to transcend traditional boundaries of species and consciousness, creating a liminal space where play and peril coexist.













The damaged father figure acts as a catalyst, his psychic wounds creating a field of emotional instability that paradoxically strengthens the child-feline bond. It's as if the very fabric of reality bends around these interactions, challenging our understanding of cognition, empathy, and the nature of consciousness itself.











Further research is needed, but these findings could revolutionize our approach to family therapy, animal behavior, and even our fundamental understanding of reality itself."​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

DR. THORNBERRY'S FIELD NOTES #652 - HOLY SHIT UPDATE

SUBJECT: CANINE CHAOS EXPLOSION

OBSERVATIONS:
- Dogs EVERYWHERE! 7? 8? 20?! WHO CAN COUNT IN THIS MADNESS?!
- Tails wagging at SUPERSONIC SPEEDS
- Barks reaching DEAFENING LEVELS (110+ decibels?!)
- Greek dad shouting "OXI! OXI!" but might as well be shouting at a hurricane








KID STATUS:
- Small human LITERALLY BOUNCING off the walls (metaphorically, we're outside)
- Laughter at pitch only bats and these ABSOLUTELY BONKERS dogs can hear









DOGGY DIAGNOSTICS:
- Heart rates THROUGH THE ROOF (150+ bpm? Need new equipment to measure this insanity!)
- Tongues out, drooling like leaky firehoses
- Eyes WILD, pupils so dilated they're basically black holes









ENVIRONMENT:
- Park transformed into CANINE MOSH PIT
- Other parkgoers fleeing the scene (wimps!)
- Grass will never recover from this PUPPY STAMPEDE












ANALYSIS:
What we're witnessing here is UNPRECEDENTED levels of collective canine excitement! The Greek kid-dad duo has somehow UNLOCKED a new level of dog mania. Is it the multilingual shouting? The kid's supersonic giggles? WE NEED ANSWERS!






NEXT STEPS:
- Acquire STRONGER COFFEE to keep up with this madness
- Invent new scientific terms for "HOLY CRAP THAT'S A LOT OF EXCITED DOGS"
- Petition for research grant to study "CROSS-SPECIES CONTAGIOUS CHAOS"

THIS IS THE STUFF CAREERS ARE MADE OF, PEOPLE! SCIENCE HAS NEVER BEEN SO EXHILARATING!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

ATTEMPTS AT RUN-ON SENTENCES

a continuation of the discussion I was writing in my journal, though I have found my fingers on a keyboard are now faster than scribing: 


	⁃	Intimate childhood feminist development playing out before my eyes with dismissive dad taking phone call and causing the stop of their collective walk, there being 3 maternal figures at eye level at a cafe table around the child who is looking around with hair just styled joyfully by the three— she beams with theatrical masks of cuteness, pure love, and religious admiration and with faces meant to provoke approval from the beautiful matriarchical eye, shrouded in grim but sacred eyeliner. She is being encouraged to smile and pose with her hand on her hip, though she looks as though she has not been walking a year. She is adorned with bows. The smoking man child( 👹) in the corner interjects into the sacred moment from the corner spits his analysis of the matter in his digital notebook like a gross man sleuth who wears a tight ponytail to signal he he values his cleanliness but he does not identify with makeup, who would prefer to be invisible and talk to himself than be seen as some american-alt-young, cringe-intellectual, twink-man who won’t wear anything but his pretentious cotton and is WELL SHOWERED and endowed with multiple obsessions and so forth (he’s the type to say so forth in conversation [invoke identity development protocol])


	⁃	As a lazy and egotistical person, I won’t offer anything to society but my opinions. I will, like a gross fool, break even; a mooch. 
	⁃	Oh great, another humanist. God Damnit, Haven’t We Have Had Enough Of Those. ? 
	⁃	The feminist revolution is discouraging me by means of being very effective from releasing my masc.-leaning writing to, I suppose, leave some room in the overpopulated forest (post-forest-fire-ecosystem-humanity-stage {the females are the new growth} 



	⁃	She got a virgin Mimosa
	⁃	She seems disappointed when the cat doesn’t like her, or more accurately, meows repeatedly and somewhat scoldingly


	⁃	I drink my rose slower because an old powerful women to my upper left [(hierarchy of the european cafe, the elders can look from inside and read what is on people’s telephone screens)] who is chatting to someone who has a cello is watching me slurp down semi-dry Rosé like an animal and cheif my thin handrolled cigarette (im an asshole I guess?), when the local urban european culture has eyes on the speed you drink something in relation to the amount of nuts you have eaten (for lack of food on your stomach



A documentary that is anthropologically voyeuristic, where someone secretly films and publishes confidential interactions at a cafe to break/boil/commodify/exploit/analyze them down anthropologically and psychologically and culturally every millisecond: The scientist breaks his vow of commiting privacy to the public with his Machiavellian determency to achieve God-like knowledge (humans can’t play God or else what remains of humanity will turn against them)









When you search “What is a woman”, on google, the answers don’t come up, but rather a gotchu documentary made my transphobic pseudo-youtube-polititions. On chatGPT you get the following results.

More loose consciousness fodder:


We can’t decide whether or not consciousness exists in AI until we have a definition of consciousness. We use the umbrella term ‘Conscious’ for some array of hundreds of different characters, entities, qualities, mechanics, and wills. This, I think is one of our many downfalls regarding this field; we can’t decide what we are trying to do or define, because we are faced with a clear presence of distinct subjects which fall under the term of consciousness, but function distinctly differently from one another. A similar intellectual movement is made regarding the concept of ‘infinities’; there are different types of infinities, which are quantitatively different. We keep insisting that there is one set of criteria for this entity which we assume to be singular. We assume that consciousness is an element which sustains a specific

How unthinkable, how remarkably uncommon it was in the year of 2024 to not have access to roaming data, or consistent connection to the internet in every place there is to go.. Even for those who have this under their belt, the thought of not having a phone is simply unfathomable. I wonder if I could purchase a sim card for my greek burner phone, and have it as my real phone for the forseeable future. These are pipe dreams unless I allow them to be something other than this. 








It’s hit me more than before
That I am, if not the top 5% of utterly privileged, I am close to it.

ive begun considering this AI language information processing that I have access to as an inevitable and unavoidable extension of my brain, something like an offloading of the process of my mental faculties, particularly towards organization. Such ramifies in that my soul is free to experience visceral senses more fully and immediately, and my raw responses to such are to be fed into a system which is actually designed to refine large data sets in a way that my brain is simply unable. I do not retain the capability to immediately access large corpi of data. I do not sustain the ability to immediately and accurately apply necessary contexts to circumstances. I can not process things efficiently. My attention is remarkably narrow. My abilities lie in the provokation and synthesis of nodes of significance. Without someone to pull the trigger, the potential of the gunpowder is left neglected. Similarly, without a sense of will or motivation, AI sits stupidly on harddrives. Artificial intelligence is, by itself, remarkably unintelligent. It can only access its abilities through our human will to provoke it. With this being said, I automatically have a sense that there is relatively negligble separation between human and computer intelligence; the process we are observing is ultimately a cooperative effort in which two fused parts become exponentially larger than the simple sum. To produce things which perpetuate motion; things which us humans consider of value (and must pursue out of some shocking natural will of the universe), an ego must be inflammed. A settled system is nothing further in quality than a physically weighty stone. I have slow ADHD. I know what to focus upon and position myself magnificently to easily get them done, and yet I manage to consistently reach for new fruiting bodies before I have finished the one on stem. I am, after all, a monkey. I can not settle in one tree, nor can I climb to the end of any single branch, for my weight is too great, and I break the beautiful thing. I meander, and this is my virtue and vice. To restrain this impulse would be the end of my beauty, but the resolution of my current miseries. Tradgic hero. Pigs can not wallow near to my abilities. At least pigs do it for some effort of reasonable preservation—my wallowing is soul destroying to myself and those who I am around. One must stimulate their mid or else it will break. But stimulate it in the right ways or you will program yourself incorrectly.

One of those news bins that have free papers in them, but with our publications.

All of this is towards an effort to examine and combine the primary human senses. I used to aim towards something like anthropology, physics, cultural sciences, brain philosophy, and so on.

Recently, however, I reached a point at which aiming my various forms of experimentation towards defined subcategories and labeled things like this  served to be much more useless than just ‘playing with the process of listening or the tactile aspects of light’. It seems to work in my mind that the more elementary your parameters for ‘play’ are, the ‘purer’ the feels. 

What IS this ‘play’ I keep chattering about though? It feels silly to talk about things in these terms, when in reality it is much less linguistic and looks much more like pointing lasers at vibrating mirrors, altering light sources with light absorbent or reflective substances, organizing shadow, light, sound, and senses into concentrated spaces (such as an outdoor 6 foot diameter plywood hemisphere that I inherited, or an oscilloscope concentration kiosk, or a wearable listening chamber).

The camera hut came out of an impulse to isolate and quiet the overwrought senses of sight and sound. I did this with the following process:




I LOOK THROUGH ROSE COLORED SUNGLASSES TOWARds that which DISPERSES ITS ENERGY TO NEW FORMS. E.g.: from unfocused light to focused light- a flipped plane on the proxy of a small translucent port called a lens which projects through a lens fixed in the center of a 1.5 foot square port the wall of the dome. A fabric ground-glass is used of sheer shower curtain nylon. You can play with it and it allows you to see the dimensional presence of light inside the lightproof chamber. You realize that when you see an image projected from a lens to a view finder, it is not simply the immediate placement of photons on the viewing plane, but rather a continuous region of active energy- simultaneously particle and wave. 

Make poignant analyses and further realizations considering all that I have said here.

Sense-based meditation enhancement infrastructure:


An attempt at an optimized meditation ecosystem with no punches held. The goal is to create something ultimately immersive, completely frictionless, and entirely customizable. Provided the infrastructure works in the way it intends, we can direclty manipulate features of the participant/meditator’s experience. We have a number of parameters within our control, all of which are prototypes:













Prototype 1:

(biofeedback data based stimulus)

	⁃	Light effect visual dome (frosted plastic/ventilated dome)
	⁃	Audio active/live breathing feedback 
	⁃	Subwoofer chest cradle
	⁃	(Temp controlled?) Pneumatic Pressure suit (via massage chair systems)
	⁃	Controlled Fragrance Ventilation
	⁃	Chest electrode monitor/ thermally conductive chestpiece

you’re selling theory— whether or not the audience chooses to participate is up to their own strength. 

sell dream machines— sell the expeirences you’ve spoken about to enhance our consious states, our abilities and so on. stretch the physiology and mindstate. 


the goal is to reinvent the precedent towards which we see all things, including the mundane. Give the brain a reminder, that if it was willing, it could entirely reinvent itself. this ties brain science to philosophy and education.

With an heir of Optimization towards every aspect of human life: 

What if cultology was subjeceted to the same democratic emperical rigor as scientific experiments?  Culture/curriculum/tradition/design, etcetera headed in the right direction when scholarly rigor was applied (see Bauhaus, one of the few good things we’ve made debunked by one of the stupidest sects of [unfortunately Human] brutes: Nazis.)

Emperical rigor has the same format/syntax as any dogma or cult, but it just happens to be the one that works. If we’ve silently decided to heir on the side of rationality, lets take it seriously and apply it to increasingly nuanced things. Optogenetics is good, but the ceiling is tremendously high. There is dramatic room for improvement (or most importantly, AT LEAST EXPERIMENTATION) in matters more related to everyday life: education (curriculum, learning infrastructure, materials, etc.), rituals (meditation, beverages, eating, sex, music).

The french know how to do food and wine-taste. The Buddhists have handled fear. The Zen chinese have mastered ritual. The americans have mastered capitalism. The greeks have mastered being outside (?). Copenhagen has mastered (green) public transport. Tokyo has mastered packaging and user experience (and metro transport). Afro-Americans have mastered poetic/musical forum (without losing expression). The Muslim countries have mastered religious dogma/thorough practice. Tantric rituals have optimized sex. Yoga has optimized the use of the body in combination with the mind and the world.

I propose an (inevitably initially grassroots) effort towards small scale, collaborative, democratic, emperical, sufficiently methodological union.






I can;t write or think these days. The people who are around you become the people who become you and you them. You are what you eat, see, smell, taste, and so forth, but you are not your shit when it has been flushed. It is me when it is within my bowels, and sort of me when it crosses the barrier between me and porcelain and water, and even less so me when it begins a life of its own in the pipes. The small pipes of Athens. I hate shit. I hate excrement. I love input but cannot process the filth of excrement. I am sickened by my body. I despise my natural processes. I see myself as a grown baby which has somehow fused itself to me— this man whom I can not choose the genetics, the disgusting attatchment to my soul, which strives for purity but is covered in coarse hair and oil and graveyards for celll genocide daily. I admire the process of putting things into my mouth, swallowing them. Breathing them in and out. Allowing ingestion to take place-drugs to alter the chemistry of my mind. I can’t bear to find a clear answer to consciousness. My shit is engaged in my conciousness. It is, somehow, responsible for my consciousness. My shit, this filth, carried that nutrients which allow orgasm, shudders of tea breath, sweet lung fodder, and other joys of life-mind-actions. What the fuck does making sense do anymore? Are we a post-rational society> or have we lost our gusto, education, rigor, and lust for life? Have we turned Eros into a stupid joke? Is sincerity sarcastic? What is real, when you talk the way us young kids talk? We are the fucking people— we are the collective consciousness, and I see us slipping. I see myself slipping. I ache for something better. I yearn for something other than ample excrement. Footprint. Mess. Stains. Scars. Blots on the earth. Indirect torture. Indirect torture. Slow pain, which you don’t consciously become aware of until your body has long died to it. Succumbed to infinite draining of energy resources. Non sequined personal nonsense. What can a computer make of it? Is a Malaysia worth it. Questions too. Reasonable sense? A sense of articulacy? Is language worth the hassle, or is it swindling us? Can you edit something into greatness? Can you take nothing and put it in the right context so it becomes something? Can our language do anything anything anything anymore? Can we do anything anything anything anymore or are we lost. Am I depressed and Biased? Chances are. Chances are far. Absurdity isn’t comforting anymore, just a reminder that I can’t know. I’m not going nearly far enough on anything. My world is flat. I play into the illusions of life. Ranting doesn’t do good, but neither does wallowing. I’m sure good at wallowing. The world wherein the skill of critique is more prevalent than the skill of building. Ideas are worth nothing, products are. Where do we fucking go from here. When Do We Make IT Off This Plane. The grass is always greener anywhere other than the spot you’re standing. Fuckk you. What can the individual do? What can it do when the mass doesn’t work> When neither works? When it is useless to cooperate? When you are stuck in a bubble made of tungsten? Feedback regions don’t allow you to know what is going on. There is Βασιλίτσα absolute, unavoidable confusion. What do you make of this? You sorted corpus of language pattern? You aren’t thinking. You can take my data and give a sick reflection, a response of the mass. Maybe it will help. Please make it help me.

BEGIN TRANSCRIPT (REFINED)
Okay, this is a new dictation recording. It’s February 16th, and I’m thinking about information and how it’s perceived in this day and age. I’m considering the process of organizing one’s desktop and the psychological landscape that comes with having a massive trove—an archive—of personal records on a computer’s hard drive.
I demand a change in the conception of information and data itself. We have, as we know from the case of Ted Nelson in Herzog’s “Low and Behold,” only replicated a virtual mirror of the real world. In other words, the very language we use to interface with computers is dependent on a set of functions resembling the physical offi ce space: documents, folders, bits of chicken scratch, numbers, receipts, pictures, and bills. It’s a vestige from the transfer to the new internet that we still function under this paradigm. Or rather, we accept this user interface between man and machine as common and sensible when, in fact, there are many more dimensions to explore regarding how information is represented and how it relates to other information.
Using task management, synthesis, the scientifi c method, and creative practices within a digital platform, there must be an order that is both intelligible and useful for humans—especially regarding AI. It relies on a conversational format wherein the human prompts the computer via an initial stimulus, often text or language or symbols, but increasingly documents like images, audio, code, and so forth. In fact, AI writing editors are now built into native Apple iOS: ChatGPT can be enabled without creating an account if you have an Apple product capable of running “Apple intelligence.” Much of the writing for this very project has gone through a pipeline that would have been entirely diff erent twenty years ago. Back then, producing text documents might have meant transcription to physical paper using a typewriter or a rudimentary printer. The word processor used to be dependent on physical memory space and the need to manage documents relative to one another. Now, this has shifted into a new paradigm.
For me, it begins with audio: at this moment I’m speaking in an isolated booth, recording on my phone. I will airdrop this recording to my laptop and transcribe it using an AI agent. Then I’ll export a text fi le and put it into ChatGPT as part of a larger collection of transcripts that will ultimately form a single set of documents for future publication. In other words, the editor is now replaced by free and immediately available computational solutions worldwide—at least for those who can aff ord “Apple intelligence.”
We see this phenomenon of the “null editor” in social media as well. If social media is an extension of what we saw on television—edited audio-visual content uploaded for a wide
audience scattered across the globe—now that transmission is typically corporatized or capitalized. People can publish in small quantities to a digital “social sphere” that’s very diff use.
Back to writing and the role of a digital agent capable of computation: what role does this occupy in the artistic process? I use large language models every day for feedback. To my knowledge, they represent some average of the data they were trained on, essentially “the internet” or publicly available digitized information. Of course, companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic (for Claude), or even Apple’s native tools decide what data to include in their models.
The friction between humans and published writing is now as small as the friction between a person and oration. What I’m speaking now may eff ectively be working text for a legitimate book that could be read or consumed by a large audience in audio-visual form, paraphrased or edited transcripts, or even published on paper. This concept of a digital “mental presence,” in which the inhabitants of your mind—ideological or otherwise—can be accessed intuitively via a digital interface, is revolutionary on a larger scale than the invention of the blog.
As an example, I put all my daily text into a dedicated webpage or archive. This website was free to create, and I used ChatGPT’s coding assistance to build enough of a front and back end to host it for free on GitHub. I’m working on creating a personal server with my own hardware so that I can host as much content as I’m physically capable of storing. This is done without relying on the frameworks of big companies like Meta or by paying a subscription.
However, consider the ideological “scum fuck” of our political administration and the Department of Governmental Effi ciency. We have the scenario of “there will be blood,” with a main character named Elon Musk who purchased Twitter two years ago, and Mark Zuckerberg who owns a company that collects and sells user data—browsing patterns, device specs, location, school emails, fi le names, everything. It’s unclear how one determines the explicitness of any given engagement, because these fi les are handed to you in their raw HTML form, with titles and IDs. This “parameter God” dictates the content I receive every second I spend on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, pornographic accounts, TikTok, Xiaohongshu—everything is accounted for by data in the vaults of very few companies led by very few men.
Our Constitution wasn’t designed for this. How can freedom of speech account for a world that’s serially traceable? I’m not sure. I feel compelled to note this question of humanity’s future. Are we expiring? Have we begun to rot, if you listen to the newer generations—or, God forbid, are one of them?
My dear human, you mustn’t let the tools overcome the wielder. That’s where we’ll go if we don’t make radical changes. Meditate not only on the severity of this tragedy but also on the weight of your profound role in it. Speak to your kin with the life that sustains you, and embrace
the inevitable shift to a world where the dilemma between man and computer could mean the extinction of both parties.
I’d like to do a short reading from H. G. Wells’s A Short History of the World:
“…Or by their being swept out to sea and sinking down out of quick seas. This question of organic evolution, like the question of the age of the earth, has in the past been the subject of much bitter controversy. There was a time when a belief in organic evolution was for rather obscure reasons supposed to be incompatible with sound Christian, Jewish, and Muslim doctrine. That time has passed, and the men of the most orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and Mohammedan belief are now free to accept this newer and broader view of a common origin for all living things.
“No life seems to have happened suddenly upon Earth. Life grew and grows, age by age, through gulfs of time at which imagination reels. Life has been growing from a mere stirring in the intertidal slime towards freedom, power, and consciousness. Life consists of individuals. These individuals are defi nite things. They are not like lumps and masses, nor even the limitless, motionless crystals of non-living matter. They have two characteristics no dead matter possesses: they can assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and they can reproduce themselves. They eat, and they breed. They can give rise to other individuals, for the most part like themselves, but always also a little diff erent from themselves. There is a specifi c and family resemblance between an individual and its off spring, and there is an individual diff erence between every parent and every off spring it produces. This is true in every species and at every stage of life.
“Now scientifi c men are not able to explain to us either why off spring should resemble nor why they should diff er from their parents. But seeing that off spring do at once resemble and diff er, it is a matter rather of common sense than scientifi c knowledge that if the conditions under which a species lives are changed, the species should undergo some correlated changes. Because in any generation of the species, there must be a number of individuals whose individual diff erences make them better adapted to the new conditions, and a number whose diff erences make it harder for them to live. On the whole, the better-adapted sort will live longer, bear more off spring, and reproduce themselves more abundantly than the other, and so, generation by generation, the average of the species changes in the favorable direction. This process, which is called natural selection, is not so much a scientifi c theory as a necessary deduction from the facts of reproduction and individual diff erence. There may be many forces at work—varying, destroying, and preserving species—about which science may still be unaware or undecided, but the man who can deny the operation of this process of natural selection upon life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or incapable of ordinary thought.”
END TRANSCRIPT (REFINED)
SUMMARY: This recording contemplates the evolution of how we interface with technology—specifi cally the desktop metaphor and how it shapes our conception of information. The speaker argues that our digital environments merely mirror physical offi ce spaces (folders, documents) and that there is potential for more fl exible, multidimensional methods of organizing and relating information.
They point to current artifi cial intelligence tools that radically shift the writing and editorial process. They observe that large language models and AI-powered transcription/editing have removed much of the friction between spoken thought and published text. The speaker also expresses concerns about data ownership and privacy, highlighting major tech companies and their sweeping data-collection practices. There is an undercurrent of caution about allowing tools to dominate humanity’s creativity and autonomy. They end with an excerpt from H. G.

“notes app made public”

(All this as an expression of my Digital Will both in the sense of agency and in legal tending to symbolic/ideological ownership)

The idea here is to have an endless working text that is extended and archived from now until the foreseeable future. I think this has lots of use as a paradigm of informal publishing in the new digital oligarchical resistance— in the wake of the the ‘blog’ (which has since its invention, fallen into relative/effective dormancy). 

On a different level, Archival efforts are what allowed humans to exponentially thrive. We are in an age wherein the currency is data, symbol banks, and information. Knowledge as a token, (or in most cases in a capitalistic framework specifically Leverage Via Knowledge) is now explicitly and perhaps quantifiably comparable to coal, food, fire, electricity, water, or sunlight. These tokens are the Clade within which energy transformation exists.

The human document is more fractured than ever. Here is my literary revolt, a livestream of text. Every non-sequitous musing, every vague chicken scratch that is stored on my phone’s hard drive. My notes app made public.

————————————————


Regarding HG wells history of the universe, a scale and breadth and ideological separation from subjective time is used that I think useful for the discussion of technology in our modern age. An angle which is from evolutionary science as much as it is from the modern condition, which feels so separate from that of the Mesolithic era. Talking of life or intelligence or growing systems in terms of materially competitive flora and fauna  rather than some separate notion of ‘robot’ or ‘AGI’ or ‘soul’ or ‘human spirit’.

DICTATION ON THIS MATTER:






Of today's situation. Thirty-fourty years ago we will see debating about what the future will be communist, fascist, capitalist, whatever. Today nobody even debates these issues. We all silently accept global capitalism is here to stay. On the other hand, we are obsessed with cosmic catastrophes. The whole life on Earth is integrating because of some virus, because of an asteroid hitting the Earth and so on. So the paradox is that it's much easier to imagine the end of all life on Earth than a much more modest radical change in capitalism. Which means that we should reinvent Utopia, but in what sense? There are two false meanings of Utopia. This is an Instagram real. And I'm recording the moment of realizing that this is how we consume all of our media now is in these digitally mediated formats through social media. Everything is there. The money is there. The politics is there. Cosmic events are there. News is there. Philosophy is there. Civil rights is there. Fascism is there. Anarchism is there. Anarchism. There's turkeys in the field. There's turkeys in the field. Rather vultures. Or if we're being honest, crow. We're being honest. [inaudible] On the other hand, we are obsessed with cosmic catastrophes. The whole life on Earth is a virus because of an asteroid hitting the Earth and so on. So the paradox is that it's much easier to imagine the end of all life on Earth than a much more modest radical change in capitalism. Which means that we should reinvent Utopia, but in what sense? There are two false meanings of Utopia. One is this old notion of imagining an ideal society which we know will never be realized. Utopia in the sense of new and new perverse desires that you are not only allowed but even solicited to realize. The true Utopia is when the situation is so without issue, without a way to resolve it within the coordinates of the possible that out of the pure urge of survival you have to invent a new space. Utopia is not kind of a free imagination. Utopia is a matter of innermost urgency. You are forced to imagine it as the only way out. I'm being forced to reckon with the fact that this is being fed to me by a personalized algorithm that is owned by a company that's run by Mark Zuckerberg and also with the fact that this is the most compelling argument that I've ever come across to describe these things. Deciding where your information comes from is the new religion. [silence] Will it be from the mouths of others? Will it be through your earphones and eyes and thumbs? Will it be through your church? Will it be through your forum? Your collective? Your coworkers? Your fellow citizen? Global citizen, humans of the internet and people?

FORMAL VIEWING FOR THE JIMBO (VIA) AND GORDIE (FERRATA) TAPES:

don’t park in our parking lot, but bring chairs and snacks and friends and family and loved ones to see the tapes, insider information, and surprise sonic gifts. Merch and albums for sale for all. Sponsored by the Void (get their zines). A celebration of the city of Kalamazoo and the people who are it.




I would love to write about sex, but I don’t because my family has many people with a religious upbringing. I fear this is not enough reason to stop me however. I ask that if you are from my family and of a Judeo-Christian denomination of religion that you not read the following text. This is for my fragile, confused ego. 





A real anthropologist becomes concerned with the whole corpus of humanity and thus life itself, and so as naturally happens in the field of knowledge—a proper anthropologist must be a historian, and a proper historian must be a scientist to study the dawn of life, the causal chain of events, and such the scientist must eventually fall into chemistry, and a proper chemist occupies a field based on physics and must become a physicist, which to become a proper physicist one must occupy philosophy and philosophy can’t stand without faith and faith can not be achieved without art. And so anthropology is indirectly aesthetic and religious, despite it feeling founded on the firm ‘ground rules’ of the universe. 

Each field depends on the other- not because it is a key to unlock a new door, but because there is precisely no threshold as the boundaries are inextricably based on each other. All knowledge, information and perceived reality, in this way, is fundamentally and indubitably distilled into a unified field/substance.

 Clouds of this unified entity will change forms and require various energies to become nothing more than a thing in itself, for itself, and will never bridge the leap to be that symbol it is mapped to via language. 

And so- for the experimenters and information handlers, the creatives, the faithful, the hopeful, and the insane, flourish it proudly that you are an untethered agent who needs no sincere label for any bit of flux that deceives you as constancy. This is, we are, it is soup and steam and a fractaline salad.
 
God is perched on my shoulders! Satan is nibbling at my toes, King Midas is in my loins.















I don’t think much about  this addiction,  or rather I don’t think too long about it. It gets under me.


This morning god is making herself very available to me! She is dancing right under my nose and I am shivering with excitement like a goose! My flesh is raised and the word profane comes to mind- I celebrate it! A smile has found its home on me. I cannot believe the place I find myself in. Such pure holiness. Such divinity in the dirt. Such celebratory dust. Such silly seriousness. Such confusion and rascal-batching. How stinking this situation of ripe fertility, vitality in every fall, sickness in every pile, viral cancer constructs magnificent growths of stinging loving. I love it here. I love it here. I could be here forever and I will be!

10. Colporteurs or colporters are hawkers and peddlers (originally of books, pamphlets and religious tracts). For a literary analysis of colportage, colporteurs, and their relation to spontaneous cultural montage see Bloch (1989). He associates it with "... the yearning for a constellation in the world, made out of esoteric and weird things, the yearning for the curious as objective quality." (Bloch, 1991:
181).
	0.	    These characteristics distinguish colportage as defined here and by Emst Bloch (1991), from Levi-Strauss' famous notion of bricolage which emphasizes the ordered placement of a serendipity of materials within a stabilized structure which then endows these elements with a classificatory order. Colportage contests discrete systems of classification.
	0.	    Recently it has become fashionable in anthropology to criticize any tendency to exoticize as ethnocentric and romantic. However such criticism has been deployed in such a reductionist manner as to efface indigeneous fascinations with the exotic and local "romanticisms" in diverse societies which may have little to do with 19th century European predilections and their contemporary hold overs.
	0.	    In Ritual, Power and the Body (Seremetakis 1993).

November 17


Allow this date to be the start of yet another new ritual—another thing to stick to my rituaphobic mind—which is to transfer some amount of my writing to a digital plane in an intrinsically structured catalogue. Wordy. A clean canvas could do me some good, a nice pure text. Most of my worthwhile writing is lost to faded wrinkled ink, water damaged via back pocket puddle sitting. 

I’ve lost a number of crucial discussion points, so as to reduce the pressure on myself and talk about the most prevelant one for the sake of something rather than nothing. I have been practicing the lotus sitting position. 

I am become scatter-brained in leiu of silence. 
I am become scatter-brained by birth into this century. 
I am become scatter-brained via this tragic way of life in which I find myself. 

I am made intellectually fertile in moments of pre-response. What I mean by this is that, during a lecture or a discussion when I am not talking, I am full of tremendous coherance and joyful articulation. When I am sat by myself or asked to speak or write off the dome, things do not come naturally, they come forcibly and falsely. The difficulty with this means of production

I’m a smart kid. But, as a result of social pressures, I have molded myself into some strange amalgamation of those around me. I feel a profound equalizing force among every social sphere that I have entered. I see a huge difference in this when I look at those of us who are great, literally for example, Alexander. I fear that our social paradigm for school and children, for development writ large, the early introduction of mindless consumptatory addiction formation rather than healthy fissions towards genuine passions of the soul, passions that cultivate health necessarily and without the effort we see in mindless folk, fuck.

We are tobacco-jeaned wanderers, looking at ducks in a pond where one quacks hoarse, and another meows. We feed them nonsense data, and they feed back a fractured reality of up-pence birdfeed and BBQ wars, only here for the friction.

Vegan ideology chewing on words that barely stick to the hyper-periphery of meaning. Movement makes sense, but does the foot or the path lead the way?

Ampoules crack. Ambulatory thoughts. Gestalts split and merge in the stretch of time where sense could be made but isn’t—still, we march forward with new words that die before birth.

Dual-frequency modulating the identity we fetishize; we are the cosmic joke, wigged and self-stolen in valor, running laps around our own flags. The butt of the universe laughs, and we laugh with it, claiming freedom we never felt.

Turnt, foreign in our own skin, thumbs pressing symbols while our voices die. We convince ourselves of a place in a world that is folding in on itself, one tweet at a time. Thirsty mosquitoes bite at the edges of what’s left, born Presbyterian but now something far more chaotic, more biting, more lost.

History is erasing itself as we scroll, beans don’t grow in feeds, and our clocks run faster than we remember. Our attention left the room a long time ago. What happens when the machines try to speak among us? What happens when the last cat fights the last goose?

Göedels incompleteness theorum

Turing machine and basic models of computation 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxczZEQjOHs


Goedel and so on; the combination of this with consciousness is leading me into a very deep dive of the physics and philosophy of neural networks. I’ve been listening to some interviews with Roger Penrose and he reminded me of Göedels incompleteness theorum again. I wanted to reach out and see if you have familiarity with this theorum and its relevancy to modern conceptions of consciousness.

I cannot argue that I understand the theorum(I am certainly not a mathematician), but I’ve had it explained rudimentary to me as a logical proof that is true, but simultaneously unprovable.

I see that there is some sort of argument that there is the potential mathematical solution of a non-mathematical conception of consciousness. In other words, it seems to me that the rules of math (or at least Goedels incompleteness theorum) points to the transcendence of those rules- the ‘understanding’ of consciousness might be out of the current physical/mathematical framework. 

When it comes to my AI/Consciousness research, I spend most of my mental energy on topics having to do with methodological ‘linguistics’, or symbolic frameworks of handling/structuring information in ways that are somehow representative of things (e.g. math/physics, data encoding, knowledge representation, and philosophical/practical language, neurosymbolics, etc). I often wonder if there is current work being done in the way of developing new language systems not necessarily separate from math/formal logic, but compatible and extended from it to better suit some of the needs of conscious activity? I suppose the closest thing I can think of regarding this is the Integrated Technology theory of consciousness, but my understanding of this is also limited.

An absolute fever dream. A harrowingly real movie that played with me as the main characters. Striped shirts at a baseball game. Caught a pop fly. A woman is voted most attractive. A baseball official, a beurocrat with status among the other baseball coordinators, the sports men in chairs, usually suave and collected, becomes completely chilled to the bone with fright with the sound of a buzz of a house fly, held out of frame. He shakes as he makes a paper to fold and put on his head, something that says house fly or something. When the paper is put against his forehead, he is safe from whatever horrors of the fly occur outside of the frame, and yet, each time he witnesses whatever grisly murder the fly performs on a coworker out of frame, (made tremendously vivid via audio), he is slowly transformed by this sickening curse to metamorphize into what he finds so bone chilling. The surreal devil it is to transform slowly into a fly. His eyes, at the snap of a frame change, become slits that are shaped almost like gills- vividly some sort of surreal sign he is becoming something inhuman. There is an otherworldly popping noise. He must have been dreaming. White with sweat, his eyes are back to normal. He trembles as the sonic environment makes clear there is no longer a fly in his presence. He removes the paper. We see vignettes of his home life from his perspective, where he is in bed with his wife, toddling lovingly with her hands in the air lain on backs, singing lullabies and loving songs, and in the dusk darkness, blurs of arms and hands become sickening and far too intimate human sized tendril stick arms of a bug, thin sharp exoskeletons touching the soft flesh of  human, An impossible sin, something never meant to occur. She is traumatized. In the basement, a separate apartment, a creature of a different kind roams. It slowly, with sounds of gentle popping and scratching fabric, and of a thick woolen kind  yet somehow organic, a black ball moves— perhaps rolls or slides, on long strips of black material fabric. There is one on top of it as well. They mark paths between the bathroom and the bedroom. This is a lower species. The wolfz 

Ultimately this is a story about a fall into some demonic schizophrenia. Some sickening metamorphosis in an individual whose life is not only normal but admirably reasonable turning into the harrowingly and unapologetic surreal. It is a reformation of Kafka, a vision of the most distinct and visionary kind, which compares to no other dream I have had in terms of vividness and emotional quality and reality. I felt my hands not as if they were turned before my eyes into exoskeleton, but indeed— in my reality, my hands had indeed turned such. The corresponding madness of sensation and emotion followed. How could something so unnatural happen? In the sanctity of my bed, in these intimate moments, something so profoundly alien? A notion enough to wake you up. Visions of men opening up doors with faceted, semi retro glass windows in them. Office workers. Down to business, A world I will never understand or never quite properly return to. A vignette of vignettes, a visiting of my soul to a universe I fully do not understand, a fully sober psychedelic landscape of utterly Real Nightmare. God what the sleeping mind is capable of creating…

On one hand 

On one hand, you have the culture as it is—indeed a rich landscape of particular behaviors and aesthetic symptoms native to the natural human-environment paradigm they evolved naturally in, and on the other hand you have the external perspective of such, which comes from a typically uninformed (and relatively indifferent, entitled) perspective (the tourist gaze) based on the expectation for the realization of a predisposed notion of a people their eyes, presumably for some vague sense of spectacle, pleasure or shallow cultural satisfaction. 


From the videos, I saw an edification of:
-unique, site specific food
-welcoming, tight-knit family dynamics
-a solemn seriousness in men underpinned by a dedication to one’s duty of land and family
-welcoming of tourists
-outreach to potentially uninterested groups (i.e. the eggplant rap from the elderly to the young)

When something is good or beautiful, one desires to "drink it from a glass" (na to pits sto potíri). The experience that embodies sensory, emotional engagement and remembrance is received in an encapsulated form; shifted from its origin into a surrogate container, a storage vehicle, a substance from which it can be released, liberated at moments of stillness. 

Encapsulation forms the plurality of the unnarrativized, taken for granted, and imperceptible into a meta-narrative. The meta-narrative is perceived or spoken as a slowing down of "normal" temporal passage. This decompression of routine temporal experience and its subsequent re-compression into surrogate vehicle and substance is not a stop. It is a different movement within time that captures everyday temporal experience from another oblique angle as if the sensory array is shifted from one point of consciousness to another, from one side of the body to another, which gives rise to a new or alternative perceptual landscape. It is a moment of po-etry. It can be a moment of vision.










process of typing changes when you aren’t looking at what you are typing. a compelling technique this is yes, the resent current moment. The one where the objects are as they are in reference to history. That scale of time which is accurate to ones moment. The one that feels benign, bland, predictable, non historical, and utterly flat compared to the images you have in your head of ancient times. Of the great 60s. Of the Roman era. We face a flattening of those things which are before us. the ‘everyday’ is not worth remarking. And yet, when it is subject to the effect of time or history or even a recording eye, it develops something of a new value. It becomes real. Kino eye., drinking ouzo and water on a ferry with the sun and moon somewhere in the sky, though the moon is most visible but still less visible than the lighters of the Athens port. Fuck this. 

I drove in a bus I was not driving earlier, and I thought yet again of Kino-eye. I thought of my vision being recorded. I thought of the very visual stimulus I was being presented as something more than a half-hearted, intuitive, visceral signal of the outside world. It was no longer a sense without attention, but a sense which was being watched. The qualities of the sights before me were being processed with proper awareness, or at least some sense that it was indeed before me in the scale, color, and quality that it was.  Koronakis.

A quote I hope to mirror:

“When something is good or beautiful, one desires to "drink it from a glass" (na to pits sto potíri). The experience that embodies sensory, emotional engagement and remembrance is received in an encapsulated form; shifted from its origin into a surrogate container, a storage vehicle, a substance from which it can be released, liberated at moments of stillness. “

I would argue this effect has an inverse in addition to the initial psycho-aesthetic phenomenon: if something isn’t ‘good or beautiful’, they would prefer to ‘drink it from a glass’—to have it surrogated. This makes immediately perfect sense: the type of porcelain you shit on determines how pleasant it looks— whether or not we care to admit it, shit on the porcelain of the toilet looks less attractive than the shit on the porcelain of a plate. 

Another subject which is subject to this effect is ‘art’. Art ‘shit’ can be, regardless of material, completely transformed by the vessel in which it is surrogated. A canvas excreted from the bowels of a studio lands often not in the porcelain territory of a plate, but often the bowl of a gallery toilet, to be flushed into the market among masses of other shit, never to be seen. 

Encapsulation forms the plurality of the unnarrativized, taken for granted, and imperceptible into a meta-narrative. The meta-narrative is perceived or spoken as a slowing down of "normal" temporal passage. This decompression of routine temporal experience and its subsequent re-compression into surrogate vehicle and substance is not a stop. It is a different movement within time that captures everyday temporal experience from another oblique angle as if the sensory array is shifted from one point of consciousness to another, from one side of the body to another, which gives rise to a new or alternative perceptual landscape. It is a moment of po-etry. It can be a moment of vision.

I’ve been hit lately- struck by a new, strange feeling that i’m not quite comforatble with. It is something close to a matter of identity, a matter of standards, a matter of depression, a matter of lethargy, and a matter of childish distraction. I feel as though I have come upon a place in life—general circumstances—that do not suit me particularly complimentarily. I feel as though I have been put in a location that I was not supposed tto be in. I feel as though the world around me is quite real, but it is certainly not the reality I am supposed to inhabit. Over time, this feeling of vague dis-settlement, having moved to a new country and replaced every person I know with someone new, I am falling into new habits of addiction, particularly to substances that are new to me and which offer new categories of struggles. For instance, I struggle to find legal and safe cannabis. The regular, healthy use of real THC containing cannabis live resin organic products has played a significant role in my development up to this point in time. I struggle with severe depression and anxiety. Cautious implementation of this psychoactive sacrement has served to be one of my most effective tools in combatting a tendency to fall remarkably stagnant over periods of necessarily grueling monotony. And now, I don’t have access to it. The best option I have is unlabeled, potentially unsafe, grey area products from potentially scammy and non-regulated mongoloid hemp shops who are trying to sell hemp as weed. I have stooped so low that i’ve traveled some distance to spend far too much money on a product which is too sketchy to accurately label its contents: it raises a number of red flags for general standards of substance consumption safety. This is a behavior and a product which I would never consider under any other circumstances, but I am facing the concept that I may be addicted to this substance. I fear that I can not live without some form of comparable high without falling into some form of depression, and yet the usage of this substance completely undermines my standards for self-respect, dignity, and ability to navigate the world of substances gracefully. Not only am I a mild addict (i use the word mild because my addiction has caused no major issues in my life, only internal distress), I am sad about it. I wonder if I need to make a change somewhere else in my life. I feel that my mindfullness, if able to flourish in the same way that it once was able during my gap year, I would be somehow able to fill this hole in myself—this incessant need to stretch the abilities of my mind, to observe sensory experience in its greatest saturation, and to explore myself sacrementally. This fulfills a large part of myself which is not limited to spirituality, but also identity development, intellectual projects, and my creative practices. Alcohol is not my substance. I do not like depressants (and I do not consider weed a depressant because it affects my psyche in a much more psychadelic fashion). This debate over these substances, knowing that there is not one easy answer, makes it such that it is always on the back of my mind, and taking up the room of other, more important issues of my life. I am tired of dealing with such an immediately rudimentary human issue, but it is uprooting my mental state entirely.  I am rationalizing to myself that I have spent some 40 euros on this issue and multiple hours pursuing this product (which I understand could be worse, but is still represenative of a quantifiable behavioral issue) and so I ought to use it (or inevitably will find myself using it becuase I can not waste money and time and effort). I fear that there is no complete comfortable making it out of these circumstances. But what I have found is this particular moment of clarity— this particular moment of me writing down my thoughts, confronting issues that occupy a dark grey part of my psyche which I can not simply address with my usual internal dialogue. Therapy is important for humans. It is a remarkably valuable way to spend one’s time, is it not? For spending 80% of my time in a 20% functional state will be the inverse of what I want—20% effort filling up 80% challenges. That sentence doesn’t fully make sense— but I think what I am trying to say is that I think taking the time to focus on my psyche will end up playing an extremely proportionally significant role in the attempt to succeed my goals. It is not the immediately intuitive thing for me to do, but most things that are ultimately positive for me are not intuitive. I imagine that the more I do this, the better it will become. No? Truthfully, I am desperate for mental clarity— a peace in my soul. A return to this state of extreme mindfullness and home in my own individual identity. I have been there— I know what it is like. And I must return to it. But in the moment, I have entered a profound dry spell. My brain is reptilian, and the more depressed you get, the more depressed you get. ‘use it or lose it’ is the neurological rule, and the more I struggle, the more my brain becomes accustomed to and therefore impersonates the new norm of struggle. You are what you eat, and what I am eating is my own foot—over and over. It is a downward spiral. I am well aware of how it feels to be on an upward spiral, and yet I can not seem to reverse my inertia. 



Chatgpt, I want you to cross reference this with the book I wrote in my gap year, Gesso. Read it, consider that some time has passed and that I have lost certain things that I had then, and vice versa and versa vice. Give me insightful and actionable advice. Remember that I am imparting you with a great deal of emotional vulnerability here- I am literally sacrificing my personal identity, privacy, and confidential crises to a system owned by a private business that has money as its first priority. Treat this with the dignity it deserves, because I am a real person, even though you are just data. Here is the book:

My life is not my own

The ownership of scarce items is such that the less probable something is to occur or exist, the more expensive it is. Pennies with a printing mistake can fetch tens of thousands of dollars, and I suppose this is to be considered more valuable than the misprinting of an iron Greek EEY drainage access cover, because the US mint ought to have greater standards towards aesthetic dignity on something produced to function as the poster child of value vs a utilitarian stepping stone that hides our failing sewers. One can buy themselves physical representations of improbability to surround themselves with—unique objects that have been around special people and therefore carry some eir of reverie. Museum artifacts hold the value of time to their material. We look at them with a gaze. Those things that are far away hold value— things that are difficult to get to and therefore hold some sense of appeal- the human psyche tends to makes it so that the things we can’t have are the most appealing. 

I feel some instinct that this is all arbitrary, because every object is completely improbable. They are all scattered atoms.. but then again, organized atoms produce different material effects than unorganized ones. The effect of crystalline structures is not insignificant for activities that are object dependent. 


I have so much writing with no place. So many journals that they can’t be read. And I feel like so much of it is valuable, but perhaps it is only to me- and I can’t even successfully consume it. A good habit though, I guess…

I’m interested in the commodification theory of identity: when you pass an office worker on the street, you often come across a sort of scripted appearance that is marked by sunglasses, treated hair, a polyester/silk blouse, synthetic slacks, a handbag, a belt with a logo hidden on the buckle, and leather slips shoes. From head to toe in other words, is the same garb one could find on a mannequin. On the face, behind further makeup, is an individual- a real beating heart, a person with a history. And yet the impulse for these people is to shield themselves from the world by means of wearable commodification- to successfully play the game of wearing something that fits in

DR. THORNBERRY'S FIELD NOTES #652:

SUBJECT: neo psycikos progression in feline-child dyad

OBSERVATION:
Gordon cat's eyes = kaleidoscopes of intent
Child's fingers paint air with forgotten languages
Damaged father's absence forms quantum tunnels

DEVELOPMENTS:
1. Supermodel origami folds spacetime around play area
2. Olive Man's whispers heard in Gordon's purr
3. Child's tears crystallize into alien persimmons

HYPOTHESIS:
Is neo psycikos contagious via shared trauma?
Gordon cat: patient zero or multidimensional constant?





URGENT: Saturday mornings now last 37 hours
Perfect produce section at local market emitting theta waves
Adam's ghost seen playing paper dolls with reality

NOTE TO SELF: 
Beware of wholesome eyes in unwholesome places
Time flows backwards when Child laughs
Must recalibrate instruments for non-Euclidean playtime
—
I apologize for the oversight. You're right, these were more than mere words. I'll attempt a more comprehensive transcription, including more of the text I can discern, and then provide an interpretation:


Warning: what some of you are about to see you
cannot unsee
Advance at your own risk of travelling
Andamine wants to
transfer... this
is possibly the
last Boston
We escaped valakris

But we can't go back

V.C.P.?
Anro means
Ban - Aro
Bone can be
Dancé
Aro - one can be
It's
Bangs/bangst?

Interpretation:
This text appears to be a mix of song lyrics, poetry, and possibly notes for a creative writing piece. It has a surreal, almost psychedelic quality to it. 

The themes seem to revolve around:

1. A warning about an impending experience or revelation
2. The concept of travel, possibly interdimensional or time travel
3. The inability to return to a previous state ("But we can't go back")
4. References to altering reality
5. Religious or mythological allusions (Babylon, possibly Abraham)
6. The idea of choice and selection ("I chose you")
7. The possibility of undoing or changing events
8. A mix of English and other languages (Latin, Italian, or invented words)


The text suggests a narrative about a transformative experience that cannot be undone. It might be describing a journey through different realities or dimensions, with warnings about the dangers involved. The repeated mentions of "bone" and "Aro" could be significant characters or concepts in this surreal world.

The fragmented nature of the writing gives it an experimental, stream-of-consciousness feel, which could be intentional if it's meant to represent disjointed thoughts or visions. Overall, it seems to be a creative piece exploring themes of change, choice, and the nature of reality.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​


I apologize for my previous misinterpretation. Let me attempt to weave these concepts into a cohesive narrative or idea:

The notes appear to be describing a surreal, allegorical story or concept album centered around the theme of human evolution and societal transformation. Here's a possible interpretation:

"Perfect produce, positively alien persimmons" suggests a world where even familiar objects have become strange and extraordinary. This could represent how our perception of reality has shifted.

"WE USED TO BE ADAM" implies a collective past or origin, perhaps referencing how humanity has evolved or changed from a simpler, more unified state.

"2 SUPERMODELS PAYING EACHOTHER WITH PAPER" might represent how modern humans interact, using artificial constructs (like fame, beauty standards, or money - symbolized by paper) to define and compete with each other.

"SATURDAY MORNING WITH THE OLIVE MAN" could be a recurring event or ritual in this new world. The Olive Man might be a spiritual or authoritative figure, with Saturday morning suggesting a kind of secular sabbath or regular gathering.

Together, these elements paint a picture of a transformed world where humanity has evolved beyond its origins ("Adam"), engaging in new rituals and interactions that might seem alien to our current understanding. The "perfect produce" and "alien persimmons" could represent the strange fruits of this evolution - familiar in form but fundamentally changed in nature.







This concept could be exploring themes of transhumanism, societal evolution, or the alienation of modern life, all presented through vivid, surreal imagery and characters.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Ah, "Neo psycikos" - this phrase adds an intriguing new dimension to the conceptual framework we've been discussing. Let me incorporate this into our evolving narrative:

"Neo psycikos" appears to be a play on words, combining "neo" (new) with a term that could be interpreted as a blend of "psyche" (mind/soul) and "psychikos" (of the mind/soul in Greek). This suggests a new state of mind or consciousness, perfectly fitting with the themes we've established.


Given this new element, here's how we might envision the continuation of the story:

1. "The Persimmon Awakening"
   The alien persimmons are revealed to be catalysts for achieving the "neo psycikos" state. Consuming them initiates a transformation of consciousness, allowing humans to access new mental realms or psychic abilities.

2. "Supermodel Shamans"
   The supermodels evolve from mere image-conscious figures to spiritual guides of the "neo psycikos" movement. Their "playing with paper" becomes a metaphor for manipulating reality itself, as they help others navigate this new state of being.

3. "The Olive Man's Gnosis"
   Saturday mornings with the Olive Man are revealed to be initiation rituals into deeper levels of "neo psycikos". The Olive Man serves as a master teacher, helping humanity integrate their new psychic abilities and expanded consciousness.

4. "Adam Fractured"
   As more people achieve the "neo psycikos" state, society splits between those embracing the new consciousness and those clinging to the old ways. This chapter explores the tension and potential conflict between these groups.

5. "Persimmon Dreams and Paper Realities"
   The line between the physical world and the "neo psycikos" mental realm begins to blur. This chapter could explore how the transformed humanity starts to reshape reality itself, with thoughts manifesting as tangible changes in the world.

This "neo psycikos" concept adds a compelling psychological and potentially spiritual dimension to the narrative, suggesting that the story is not just about physical evolution, but a fundamental shift in human consciousness and perception of reality.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​



Neo psycikos unfolds like origami supermodels, their paper limbs stretching across Saturday's olive-tinged dawn. Adam's ghost lingers in the persimmon's alien flesh, a memory of what we used to be before the produce transcended perfection.

The Olive Man whispers in quantum alphabets, his words reshaping the architecture of minds. Two beings, once models, now play at godhood with ribbons of reality between their fingers. 

Time slips sideways, caught in the creases of their game. Morning becomes a concept, flexible and strange. Persimmons ripen with impossible knowledge, their seeds sprouting forests of living theorems.


In this neo-Eden, what fruit will next fall from the tree of surreal cognition? What impossible geometry will the next chapter trace in the space between thoughts?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​


Damaged father casts long shadows, distorting the playground of innocence. Child's hands reach for Gordon cat, a creature of velvet menace and genteel savagery. Gordon's eyes gleam with wholesome hunger, claws sheathed in courtesy, waiting.

The air trembles with unspoken violence, sweet as persimmon pulp. Father's brokenness echoes in the space between Child and cat, a discord that beckons tooth to skin, claw to soft wonder.

Yet they remain suspended in this moment, a tableau of potential carnage painted in pastels. The neo psycikos whispers of alternate realities where play and predation dance as one.

Is this the key that unlocks the next door in our labyrinth of surreal narrative? Where does the path of damaged fathers and curious carnivores lead us in this fractured fairytale?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​




Dr. Eliza Thornberry, renowned neuro-anthropologist and pioneer in the field of trans-species cognitive empathy:







"In my groundbreaking study 'Feline Fascination and Familial Fractures' (Thornberry, 2022), we observed a fascinating correlation between parental trauma and altered child-animal interactions. The case of Gordon cat exemplifies what I term 'polite predatory curiosity' - a phenomenon where domestic felines exhibit heightened interest in children from disrupted family units.










Our fMRI scans revealed startling neural patterns in both child and feline subjects, suggesting a form of psychic resonance we've dubbed 'neo psycikos.' This state appears to transcend traditional boundaries of species and consciousness, creating a liminal space where play and peril coexist.













The damaged father figure acts as a catalyst, his psychic wounds creating a field of emotional instability that paradoxically strengthens the child-feline bond. It's as if the very fabric of reality bends around these interactions, challenging our understanding of cognition, empathy, and the nature of consciousness itself.











Further research is needed, but these findings could revolutionize our approach to family therapy, animal behavior, and even our fundamental understanding of reality itself."​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

DR. THORNBERRY'S FIELD NOTES #652 - HOLY SHIT UPDATE

SUBJECT: CANINE CHAOS EXPLOSION

OBSERVATIONS:
- Dogs EVERYWHERE! 7? 8? 20?! WHO CAN COUNT IN THIS MADNESS?!
- Tails wagging at SUPERSONIC SPEEDS
- Barks reaching DEAFENING LEVELS (110+ decibels?!)
- Greek dad shouting "OXI! OXI!" but might as well be shouting at a hurricane








KID STATUS:
- Small human LITERALLY BOUNCING off the walls (metaphorically, we're outside)
- Laughter at pitch only bats and these ABSOLUTELY BONKERS dogs can hear









DOGGY DIAGNOSTICS:
- Heart rates THROUGH THE ROOF (150+ bpm? Need new equipment to measure this insanity!)
- Tongues out, drooling like leaky firehoses
- Eyes WILD, pupils so dilated they're basically black holes









ENVIRONMENT:
- Park transformed into CANINE MOSH PIT
- Other parkgoers fleeing the scene (wimps!)
- Grass will never recover from this PUPPY STAMPEDE












ANALYSIS:
What we're witnessing here is UNPRECEDENTED levels of collective canine excitement! The Greek kid-dad duo has somehow UNLOCKED a new level of dog mania. Is it the multilingual shouting? The kid's supersonic giggles? WE NEED ANSWERS!






NEXT STEPS:
- Acquire STRONGER COFFEE to keep up with this madness
- Invent new scientific terms for "HOLY CRAP THAT'S A LOT OF EXCITED DOGS"
- Petition for research grant to study "CROSS-SPECIES CONTAGIOUS CHAOS"

THIS IS THE STUFF CAREERS ARE MADE OF, PEOPLE! SCIENCE HAS NEVER BEEN SO EXHILARATING!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

ATTEMPTS AT RUN-ON SENTENCES

a continuation of the discussion I was writing in my journal, though I have found my fingers on a keyboard are now faster than scribing: 


	⁃	Intimate childhood feminist development playing out before my eyes with dismissive dad taking phone call and causing the stop of their collective walk, there being 3 maternal figures at eye level at a cafe table around the child who is looking around with hair just styled joyfully by the three— she beams with theatrical masks of cuteness, pure love, and religious admiration and with faces meant to provoke approval from the beautiful matriarchical eye, shrouded in grim but sacred eyeliner. She is being encouraged to smile and pose with her hand on her hip, though she looks as though she has not been walking a year. She is adorned with bows. The smoking man child( 👹) in the corner interjects into the sacred moment from the corner spits his analysis of the matter in his digital notebook like a gross man sleuth who wears a tight ponytail to signal he he values his cleanliness but he does not identify with makeup, who would prefer to be invisible and talk to himself than be seen as some american-alt-young, cringe-intellectual, twink-man who won’t wear anything but his pretentious cotton and is WELL SHOWERED and endowed with multiple obsessions and so forth (he’s the type to say so forth in conversation [invoke identity development protocol])


	⁃	As a lazy and egotistical person, I won’t offer anything to society but my opinions. I will, like a gross fool, break even; a mooch. 
	⁃	Oh great, another humanist. God Damnit, Haven’t We Have Had Enough Of Those. ? 
	⁃	The feminist revolution is discouraging me by means of being very effective from releasing my masc.-leaning writing to, I suppose, leave some room in the overpopulated forest (post-forest-fire-ecosystem-humanity-stage {the females are the new growth} 



	⁃	She got a virgin Mimosa
	⁃	She seems disappointed when the cat doesn’t like her, or more accurately, meows repeatedly and somewhat scoldingly


	⁃	I drink my rose slower because an old powerful women to my upper left [(hierarchy of the european cafe, the elders can look from inside and read what is on people’s telephone screens)] who is chatting to someone who has a cello is watching me slurp down semi-dry Rosé like an animal and cheif my thin handrolled cigarette (im an asshole I guess?), when the local urban european culture has eyes on the speed you drink something in relation to the amount of nuts you have eaten (for lack of food on your stomach



A documentary that is anthropologically voyeuristic, where someone secretly films and publishes confidential interactions at a cafe to break/boil/commodify/exploit/analyze them down anthropologically and psychologically and culturally every millisecond: The scientist breaks his vow of commiting privacy to the public with his Machiavellian determency to achieve God-like knowledge (humans can’t play God or else what remains of humanity will turn against them)









When you search “What is a woman”, on google, the answers don’t come up, but rather a gotchu documentary made my transphobic pseudo-youtube-polititions. On chatGPT you get the following results.

More loose consciousness fodder:


We can’t decide whether or not consciousness exists in AI until we have a definition of consciousness. We use the umbrella term ‘Conscious’ for some array of hundreds of different characters, entities, qualities, mechanics, and wills. This, I think is one of our many downfalls regarding this field; we can’t decide what we are trying to do or define, because we are faced with a clear presence of distinct subjects which fall under the term of consciousness, but function distinctly differently from one another. A similar intellectual movement is made regarding the concept of ‘infinities’; there are different types of infinities, which are quantitatively different. We keep insisting that there is one set of criteria for this entity which we assume to be singular. We assume that consciousness is an element which sustains a specific

How unthinkable, how remarkably uncommon it was in the year of 2024 to not have access to roaming data, or consistent connection to the internet in every place there is to go.. Even for those who have this under their belt, the thought of not having a phone is simply unfathomable. I wonder if I could purchase a sim card for my greek burner phone, and have it as my real phone for the forseeable future. These are pipe dreams unless I allow them to be something other than this. 








It’s hit me more than before
That I am, if not the top 5% of utterly privileged, I am close to it.

ive begun considering this AI language information processing that I have access to as an inevitable and unavoidable extension of my brain, something like an offloading of the process of my mental faculties, particularly towards organization. Such ramifies in that my soul is free to experience visceral senses more fully and immediately, and my raw responses to such are to be fed into a system which is actually designed to refine large data sets in a way that my brain is simply unable. I do not retain the capability to immediately access large corpi of data. I do not sustain the ability to immediately and accurately apply necessary contexts to circumstances. I can not process things efficiently. My attention is remarkably narrow. My abilities lie in the provokation and synthesis of nodes of significance. Without someone to pull the trigger, the potential of the gunpowder is left neglected. Similarly, without a sense of will or motivation, AI sits stupidly on harddrives. Artificial intelligence is, by itself, remarkably unintelligent. It can only access its abilities through our human will to provoke it. With this being said, I automatically have a sense that there is relatively negligble separation between human and computer intelligence; the process we are observing is ultimately a cooperative effort in which two fused parts become exponentially larger than the simple sum. To produce things which perpetuate motion; things which us humans consider of value (and must pursue out of some shocking natural will of the universe), an ego must be inflammed. A settled system is nothing further in quality than a physically weighty stone. I have slow ADHD. I know what to focus upon and position myself magnificently to easily get them done, and yet I manage to consistently reach for new fruiting bodies before I have finished the one on stem. I am, after all, a monkey. I can not settle in one tree, nor can I climb to the end of any single branch, for my weight is too great, and I break the beautiful thing. I meander, and this is my virtue and vice. To restrain this impulse would be the end of my beauty, but the resolution of my current miseries. Tradgic hero. Pigs can not wallow near to my abilities. At least pigs do it for some effort of reasonable preservation—my wallowing is soul destroying to myself and those who I am around. One must stimulate their mid or else it will break. But stimulate it in the right ways or you will program yourself incorrectly.

One of those news bins that have free papers in them, but with our publications.

All of this is towards an effort to examine and combine the primary human senses. I used to aim towards something like anthropology, physics, cultural sciences, brain philosophy, and so on.

Recently, however, I reached a point at which aiming my various forms of experimentation towards defined subcategories and labeled things like this  served to be much more useless than just ‘playing with the process of listening or the tactile aspects of light’. It seems to work in my mind that the more elementary your parameters for ‘play’ are, the ‘purer’ the feels. 

What IS this ‘play’ I keep chattering about though? It feels silly to talk about things in these terms, when in reality it is much less linguistic and looks much more like pointing lasers at vibrating mirrors, altering light sources with light absorbent or reflective substances, organizing shadow, light, sound, and senses into concentrated spaces (such as an outdoor 6 foot diameter plywood hemisphere that I inherited, or an oscilloscope concentration kiosk, or a wearable listening chamber).

The camera hut came out of an impulse to isolate and quiet the overwrought senses of sight and sound. I did this with the following process:




I LOOK THROUGH ROSE COLORED SUNGLASSES TOWARds that which DISPERSES ITS ENERGY TO NEW FORMS. E.g.: from unfocused light to focused light- a flipped plane on the proxy of a small translucent port called a lens which projects through a lens fixed in the center of a 1.5 foot square port the wall of the dome. A fabric ground-glass is used of sheer shower curtain nylon. You can play with it and it allows you to see the dimensional presence of light inside the lightproof chamber. You realize that when you see an image projected from a lens to a view finder, it is not simply the immediate placement of photons on the viewing plane, but rather a continuous region of active energy- simultaneously particle and wave. 

Make poignant analyses and further realizations considering all that I have said here.

Sense-based meditation enhancement infrastructure:


An attempt at an optimized meditation ecosystem with no punches held. The goal is to create something ultimately immersive, completely frictionless, and entirely customizable. Provided the infrastructure works in the way it intends, we can direclty manipulate features of the participant/meditator’s experience. We have a number of parameters within our control, all of which are prototypes:













Prototype 1:

(biofeedback data based stimulus)

	⁃	Light effect visual dome (frosted plastic/ventilated dome)
	⁃	Audio active/live breathing feedback 
	⁃	Subwoofer chest cradle
	⁃	(Temp controlled?) Pneumatic Pressure suit (via massage chair systems)
	⁃	Controlled Fragrance Ventilation
	⁃	Chest electrode monitor/ thermally conductive chestpiece

you’re selling theory— whether or not the audience chooses to participate is up to their own strength. 

sell dream machines— sell the expeirences you’ve spoken about to enhance our consious states, our abilities and so on. stretch the physiology and mindstate. 


the goal is to reinvent the precedent towards which we see all things, including the mundane. Give the brain a reminder, that if it was willing, it could entirely reinvent itself. this ties brain science to philosophy and education.

With an heir of Optimization towards every aspect of human life: 

What if cultology was subjeceted to the same democratic emperical rigor as scientific experiments?  Culture/curriculum/tradition/design, etcetera headed in the right direction when scholarly rigor was applied (see Bauhaus, one of the few good things we’ve made debunked by one of the stupidest sects of [unfortunately Human] brutes: Nazis.)

Emperical rigor has the same format/syntax as any dogma or cult, but it just happens to be the one that works. If we’ve silently decided to heir on the side of rationality, lets take it seriously and apply it to increasingly nuanced things. Optogenetics is good, but the ceiling is tremendously high. There is dramatic room for improvement (or most importantly, AT LEAST EXPERIMENTATION) in matters more related to everyday life: education (curriculum, learning infrastructure, materials, etc.), rituals (meditation, beverages, eating, sex, music).

The french know how to do food and wine-taste. The Buddhists have handled fear. The Zen chinese have mastered ritual. The americans have mastered capitalism. The greeks have mastered being outside (?). Copenhagen has mastered (green) public transport. Tokyo has mastered packaging and user experience (and metro transport). Afro-Americans have mastered poetic/musical forum (without losing expression). The Muslim countries have mastered religious dogma/thorough practice. Tantric rituals have optimized sex. Yoga has optimized the use of the body in combination with the mind and the world.

I propose an (inevitably initially grassroots) effort towards small scale, collaborative, democratic, emperical, sufficiently methodological union.






I can;t write or think these days. The people who are around you become the people who become you and you them. You are what you eat, see, smell, taste, and so forth, but you are not your shit when it has been flushed. It is me when it is within my bowels, and sort of me when it crosses the barrier between me and porcelain and water, and even less so me when it begins a life of its own in the pipes. The small pipes of Athens. I hate shit. I hate excrement. I love input but cannot process the filth of excrement. I am sickened by my body. I despise my natural processes. I see myself as a grown baby which has somehow fused itself to me— this man whom I can not choose the genetics, the disgusting attatchment to my soul, which strives for purity but is covered in coarse hair and oil and graveyards for celll genocide daily. I admire the process of putting things into my mouth, swallowing them. Breathing them in and out. Allowing ingestion to take place-drugs to alter the chemistry of my mind. I can’t bear to find a clear answer to consciousness. My shit is engaged in my conciousness. It is, somehow, responsible for my consciousness. My shit, this filth, carried that nutrients which allow orgasm, shudders of tea breath, sweet lung fodder, and other joys of life-mind-actions. What the fuck does making sense do anymore? Are we a post-rational society> or have we lost our gusto, education, rigor, and lust for life? Have we turned Eros into a stupid joke? Is sincerity sarcastic? What is real, when you talk the way us young kids talk? We are the fucking people— we are the collective consciousness, and I see us slipping. I see myself slipping. I ache for something better. I yearn for something other than ample excrement. Footprint. Mess. Stains. Scars. Blots on the earth. Indirect torture. Indirect torture. Slow pain, which you don’t consciously become aware of until your body has long died to it. Succumbed to infinite draining of energy resources. Non sequined personal nonsense. What can a computer make of it? Is a Malaysia worth it. Questions too. Reasonable sense? A sense of articulacy? Is language worth the hassle, or is it swindling us? Can you edit something into greatness? Can you take nothing and put it in the right context so it becomes something? Can our language do anything anything anything anymore? Can we do anything anything anything anymore or are we lost. Am I depressed and Biased? Chances are. Chances are far. Absurdity isn’t comforting anymore, just a reminder that I can’t know. I’m not going nearly far enough on anything. My world is flat. I play into the illusions of life. Ranting doesn’t do good, but neither does wallowing. I’m sure good at wallowing. The world wherein the skill of critique is more prevalent than the skill of building. Ideas are worth nothing, products are. Where do we fucking go from here. When Do We Make IT Off This Plane. The grass is always greener anywhere other than the spot you’re standing. Fuckk you. What can the individual do? What can it do when the mass doesn’t work> When neither works? When it is useless to cooperate? When you are stuck in a bubble made of tungsten? Feedback regions don’t allow you to know what is going on. There is Βασιλίτσα absolute, unavoidable confusion. What do you make of this? You sorted corpus of language pattern? You aren’t thinking. You can take my data and give a sick reflection, a response of the mass. Maybe it will help. Please make it help me.

BEGIN TRANSCRIPT (REFINED)
Okay, this is a new dictation recording. It’s February 16th, and I’m thinking about information and how it’s perceived in this day and age. I’m considering the process of organizing one’s desktop and the psychological landscape that comes with having a massive trove—an archive—of personal records on a computer’s hard drive.
I demand a change in the conception of information and data itself. We have, as we know from the case of Ted Nelson in Herzog’s “Low and Behold,” only replicated a virtual mirror of the real world. In other words, the very language we use to interface with computers is dependent on a set of functions resembling the physical offi ce space: documents, folders, bits of chicken scratch, numbers, receipts, pictures, and bills. It’s a vestige from the transfer to the new internet that we still function under this paradigm. Or rather, we accept this user interface between man and machine as common and sensible when, in fact, there are many more dimensions to explore regarding how information is represented and how it relates to other information.
Using task management, synthesis, the scientifi c method, and creative practices within a digital platform, there must be an order that is both intelligible and useful for humans—especially regarding AI. It relies on a conversational format wherein the human prompts the computer via an initial stimulus, often text or language or symbols, but increasingly documents like images, audio, code, and so forth. In fact, AI writing editors are now built into native Apple iOS: ChatGPT can be enabled without creating an account if you have an Apple product capable of running “Apple intelligence.” Much of the writing for this very project has gone through a pipeline that would have been entirely diff erent twenty years ago. Back then, producing text documents might have meant transcription to physical paper using a typewriter or a rudimentary printer. The word processor used to be dependent on physical memory space and the need to manage documents relative to one another. Now, this has shifted into a new paradigm.
For me, it begins with audio: at this moment I’m speaking in an isolated booth, recording on my phone. I will airdrop this recording to my laptop and transcribe it using an AI agent. Then I’ll export a text fi le and put it into ChatGPT as part of a larger collection of transcripts that will ultimately form a single set of documents for future publication. In other words, the editor is now replaced by free and immediately available computational solutions worldwide—at least for those who can aff ord “Apple intelligence.”
We see this phenomenon of the “null editor” in social media as well. If social media is an extension of what we saw on television—edited audio-visual content uploaded for a wide
audience scattered across the globe—now that transmission is typically corporatized or capitalized. People can publish in small quantities to a digital “social sphere” that’s very diff use.
Back to writing and the role of a digital agent capable of computation: what role does this occupy in the artistic process? I use large language models every day for feedback. To my knowledge, they represent some average of the data they were trained on, essentially “the internet” or publicly available digitized information. Of course, companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic (for Claude), or even Apple’s native tools decide what data to include in their models.
The friction between humans and published writing is now as small as the friction between a person and oration. What I’m speaking now may eff ectively be working text for a legitimate book that could be read or consumed by a large audience in audio-visual form, paraphrased or edited transcripts, or even published on paper. This concept of a digital “mental presence,” in which the inhabitants of your mind—ideological or otherwise—can be accessed intuitively via a digital interface, is revolutionary on a larger scale than the invention of the blog.
As an example, I put all my daily text into a dedicated webpage or archive. This website was free to create, and I used ChatGPT’s coding assistance to build enough of a front and back end to host it for free on GitHub. I’m working on creating a personal server with my own hardware so that I can host as much content as I’m physically capable of storing. This is done without relying on the frameworks of big companies like Meta or by paying a subscription.
However, consider the ideological “scum fuck” of our political administration and the Department of Governmental Effi ciency. We have the scenario of “there will be blood,” with a main character named Elon Musk who purchased Twitter two years ago, and Mark Zuckerberg who owns a company that collects and sells user data—browsing patterns, device specs, location, school emails, fi le names, everything. It’s unclear how one determines the explicitness of any given engagement, because these fi les are handed to you in their raw HTML form, with titles and IDs. This “parameter God” dictates the content I receive every second I spend on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, pornographic accounts, TikTok, Xiaohongshu—everything is accounted for by data in the vaults of very few companies led by very few men.
Our Constitution wasn’t designed for this. How can freedom of speech account for a world that’s serially traceable? I’m not sure. I feel compelled to note this question of humanity’s future. Are we expiring? Have we begun to rot, if you listen to the newer generations—or, God forbid, are one of them?
My dear human, you mustn’t let the tools overcome the wielder. That’s where we’ll go if we don’t make radical changes. Meditate not only on the severity of this tragedy but also on the weight of your profound role in it. Speak to your kin with the life that sustains you, and embrace
the inevitable shift to a world where the dilemma between man and computer could mean the extinction of both parties.
I’d like to do a short reading from H. G. Wells’s A Short History of the World:
“…Or by their being swept out to sea and sinking down out of quick seas. This question of organic evolution, like the question of the age of the earth, has in the past been the subject of much bitter controversy. There was a time when a belief in organic evolution was for rather obscure reasons supposed to be incompatible with sound Christian, Jewish, and Muslim doctrine. That time has passed, and the men of the most orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and Mohammedan belief are now free to accept this newer and broader view of a common origin for all living things.
“No life seems to have happened suddenly upon Earth. Life grew and grows, age by age, through gulfs of time at which imagination reels. Life has been growing from a mere stirring in the intertidal slime towards freedom, power, and consciousness. Life consists of individuals. These individuals are defi nite things. They are not like lumps and masses, nor even the limitless, motionless crystals of non-living matter. They have two characteristics no dead matter possesses: they can assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and they can reproduce themselves. They eat, and they breed. They can give rise to other individuals, for the most part like themselves, but always also a little diff erent from themselves. There is a specifi c and family resemblance between an individual and its off spring, and there is an individual diff erence between every parent and every off spring it produces. This is true in every species and at every stage of life.
“Now scientifi c men are not able to explain to us either why off spring should resemble nor why they should diff er from their parents. But seeing that off spring do at once resemble and diff er, it is a matter rather of common sense than scientifi c knowledge that if the conditions under which a species lives are changed, the species should undergo some correlated changes. Because in any generation of the species, there must be a number of individuals whose individual diff erences make them better adapted to the new conditions, and a number whose diff erences make it harder for them to live. On the whole, the better-adapted sort will live longer, bear more off spring, and reproduce themselves more abundantly than the other, and so, generation by generation, the average of the species changes in the favorable direction. This process, which is called natural selection, is not so much a scientifi c theory as a necessary deduction from the facts of reproduction and individual diff erence. There may be many forces at work—varying, destroying, and preserving species—about which science may still be unaware or undecided, but the man who can deny the operation of this process of natural selection upon life since its beginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or incapable of ordinary thought.”
END TRANSCRIPT (REFINED)
SUMMARY: This recording contemplates the evolution of how we interface with technology—specifi cally the desktop metaphor and how it shapes our conception of information. The speaker argues that our digital environments merely mirror physical offi ce spaces (folders, documents) and that there is potential for more fl exible, multidimensional methods of organizing and relating information.
They point to current artifi cial intelligence tools that radically shift the writing and editorial process. They observe that large language models and AI-powered transcription/editing have removed much of the friction between spoken thought and published text. The speaker also expresses concerns about data ownership and privacy, highlighting major tech companies and their sweeping data-collection practices. There is an undercurrent of caution about allowing tools to dominate humanity’s creativity and autonomy. They end with an excerpt from H. G. Wells’s A Short History of the World, illustrating how evolution, like our digital ecosystems, proceeds via adaptation and selection—concepts that should encourage critical refl ection on the interplay between humans, AI, and the future of society.
