Hello! I'm Sam Douma. I'm an interdisciplinary project-based artist and author who plays with unique forms of independent publishing. 
Here is my personal website which I co-coded (with significant assistence from coding agents such as _Claude_, _ChatGPT_, and _Cursor_,
with additional assets from other open sourced libraries and tutorials).

The website is organized by a number of different categories, printed on interactive buttons via latin titles which are the following:

Dico (Spoken orative transcripts; _I speak_)
Disco (Academic Repository; _I learn_)
Scribo (My writing; _I write_)
Audio (My audio work, musical and nonmusical; _I listen_)
Lego (My curations/bibliographies; _I gather_)
Cogito (Prototypes/Ideas/Mindmaps; _I think_)
Video (My video work; _I see_)

The structure of the website invites the viewer to participate in all sorts of interactive musings which span subject matter and medium. 
As you make your way through the various categories, your previous passeges are marked by color on the buttons you have thus explored.
