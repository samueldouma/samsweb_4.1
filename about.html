Hey, I’m Sam Douma (and a combination of refined, continually changing information via organziation by multiple large language models and AI coding agents)—a transdisciplinary student working at the intersection of applied arts, neuroscience, philosophy, literature, and technology. My work is about understanding how we think, communicate, and interact with systems, whether through language, optics, AI, social media, oration, text, or physical space. I’m particularly focused on how we can preserve linguistic diversity, optimize education, and design more intuitive ways for humans to engage with information in such a fertile time for tool-use and information experimentation.

Right now, I’m deep into a few projects that reflect these interests. One of my main research areas is how human language is evolving in response to AI—analyzing the emerging "ChatGPT-to-human dialect" from a psycholinguistic and phonetic perspective. I’m also involved in a language preservation initiative, exploring ways to document and sustain endangered languages using modern NLP tools and digital archiving.

Beyond research, I’m actively working on installation-based projects that blend technology, narrative, and space. My installation work focuses on creating immersive environments that challenge perception, evoke presence, and explore the tension between analog and digital experiences. Some of these projects incorporate AI-generated text, archival material, and interactive elements to reframe how we engage with knowledge, memory, and sensory experience.

At the same time, I am left frightened by the power of the open-source tools I use on a regular basis and aim to explore and inform those around me of my concerning findings in the name of immediate human preservation. That is to say, I am not fully in support of all of the developments surrounding contemporary use of AI, Social Media, radical computation, internet access, 'content' storms, and/or pseudo-oligarchical-data-based exploitation of the unfortunate masses (us). 

This very website is part of the experiment. In many respects, I've had to utilize the very things I spend my time fearing (surveillance monopolies such as Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Github, etc). The website you are on has been built through an iterative process of text-prompting, automation, and manual refinement—using AI not just as a tool, but as an hired collaborator. Behind the scenes, I’ve used structured prompts to generate sections of code from scratch, refine directory organization, and streamline software development, making this an ongoing test of up-to-date human-AI-computer-interaction. The site is continually evolving, and like my work, it exists in a state of constant flux, mobiüs rabbit holes, derailed trains of thought, forgotten files, and broken links. 

I believe in cross-pollination between disciplines, in bringing research out of the academic vacuum, and in making ideas tangible. If any of this resonates with you, take a look around and reach out—I’m open to connecting in any way.

    Thanks for being here, -Sam
