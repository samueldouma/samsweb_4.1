    <p>Hey, I’m Sam Douma (Sam for short). I’m a transdisciplinary student and project-based artist/author working at an intersection of many applied arts: internet ethnography, neuroscience, interactive multimedia installation, philosophy, machine learning technology, literature, and journalism (to name a few). My work is about understanding how we think, communicate, and interact with systems daily— often in the form of language (see Dico, Scribo, Disco), optics (see Video), natural language processing LLMs (see Dico, Scribo, Disco), neurological habit formation (see Disco, Cogito) psychopharmacology (see Disco), or physical space (with my installations). I’m particularly focused on how we can efficiently preserve linguistic diversity, experimentally optimize education in the information age, and design more intuitive ways for humans to engage with information in such an informationally fertile and technologically privileged historical moment.</p>

    <p>Right now, I’m deep into a few projects that reflect these interests. One of my main research areas is how human language and digital culture is evolving in response to AI. I have done this in multiple ways:</p>

    <p>First, in the form of an ongoing epistolary dialect ‘diary’, which is really more of an archive of my prodding conversations with early large language models (primarily Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini). This candid archive demonstrates the LLM-human dialect in its strange infancy, highlighting the psycholinguistic trials and tribulations which eventually lead to inevitable madness and/or psychosis on the end of the human user.</p>

    <p>Second, I am also involved in a language preservation initiative, exploring ways to document, sustain, and encode endangered languages into neural networks, using a distinct encoding protocol that prioritizes linguistic diversity.</p>

    <p>Beyond research, I’m actively working on installation-based projects that blend technology, narrative, and space. My installation work focuses on creating immersive environments that challenge perception, evoke presence, and explore the tension between analog and digital experiences. Some of these projects incorporate AI-generated text, archival material, and interactive elements to reframe how we engage with knowledge, memory, and sensory experience.</p>

    <p>This very website is part of the experiment. In many respects, I've had to utilize the very things I spend my time fearing (surveillance monopolies such as Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Github, etc). The website you are on was built through an iterative process of frankensteining open-source code, LLM text-prompting, code repairing automation, and tedious trial and error. The site is continually evolving and never up to date. Like my work, it exists in a state of constant flux, mobiüs rabbit holes, derailed trains of thought, forgotten files, and broken links.</p>

    <p>I believe in cross-pollination between disciplines, in bringing research out of the academic vacuum, and in making ideas tangible. If any of this resonates with you, take a look around and reach out—I’m open to connecting in any way.</p>

    <p>Thanks for being here,<br>- Sam</p>
